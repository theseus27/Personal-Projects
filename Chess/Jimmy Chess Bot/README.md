# ChessEngine

## About

This is a chess engine created for a computer science research class. It plays at an intermediate level and can be run locally or through the [LiChess API](https://lichess.org/api).

## Features

This chess engine utilizes minimax search with alpha-beta pruning as its general move finding algorithm. It also implements quiescence search, zobrist hasing, and a complex evaluation algorithm to aid with playing strength.

I never got to say goodbye, even if there was no one to say goodbye to.
But maybe it would have been worse if there was.
I'm still the kid who made people thought he had a real dog, not a stuffed one.
The same boy who played with Smokey, when she wouldn't let anyone else approach.
And now I'm a man.
And I'm not ready.
I feel like I missed an entire childhood, an experience to shape me, to guide me, to let me know what the fuck I'm doing.
Instead I wasted 17 years, learning a language I would never get to speak.
I'm literally years behind everyone else, and I'm still trying to learn how to be a boy, let alone a man.

Coming out was just the start. It was easy. It was short and yielded immediate results.
This is when it gets hard.
Now is the grind.
The sweat.
The pain.
Say goodbye to sugar, to carbs.
Eat lean meat, egg whites, whey, fish.
Workout. Progressive overload. 30 mins a day. 5 times a week.
Drink coffee if you need to kick the appetite.
You finally have the physical tools to do this.
Now it's time to get your head in the game.


MAR 27 2021 – Voice Memo
        Took 1 and 1/3 squares after finishing homework for the night, and was gonna watch the SU game (spoiler: they lost). I ended up jerking off, and then singing for like 2 hours. My voice/singing sounded so good, and I felt like I had so much more control. Listening back it wasn’t amazing but I could definitely hear the enunciation. I’m gonna transcribe some of it here. I ended up drinking 5-6 water bottles. I ate a sleeve of caramel rice cakes (350 calories) and probably half a bag of cheez-its (500 calories) so rip.


Transcription
* **Was trying to talk in a gay voice**
* “Weirdly enough, it makes me sound more masc. My voice is only high because I want it to be.”
* “When I picture myself in my body, I see this drawing with a white background, with blue/pink/yellow/brown scribbles”
* “I think I like laying down during trips cuz everytime I move something or think about my body it loses the fluidity. I think that’s what causes the choppiness. If you just lay back and look at the picture in your mind it's a lot more fluid. It's more fluid than any real screen could be. It looks more fluid than real life.”
* **Syracuse game in the background**
* **I sat there for a minute thinking I was gonna puke**
* “I feel like I would be puking except I’m too dehydrated and my body is like ‘no’”
* **In a lower voice** “Is my voice more masculine? It’s like the cords aren’t trying to lift themselves. I mean I feel like I could talk at this level...like it wouldn’t be comfortable, but I could do it. Well no I couldn’t. I’d have to be consciously thinking about it. I mean yeah, maybe I could do this. Maybe a little higher. Yeah this feels comfortable. I mean, I don’t really know. I feel like it’s going to continue to drop, until it settles in right around here. Or here. I can definitely hear the tonal difference now between this and this. Like when you’re down here you do have to speak a little more authoritatively and like pronounce the ends of your words cuz you still need to be hearing yourself in the sound, and since its vibrating at a lower frequency, you need to compensate for that, so if you wanna hear yourself at a constant level, a constant voice pitch, you really do need to enunciate the ends of your sentences. Like now I hear my voice as a much smoother masculine voice (9:30)”
* “I’m trying to think of who it reminds me of. I feel like it reminds me of these boys I knew in sixth or seventh grade - like Jace Depuy or Mikey Howe. I guess now I sound more like a prepubescent boy and less like a weirdo with his voice cords quivering. The more I’m talking the more it's sounding fluid and not like vibratey in my head. Maybe talking louder allows it to even out better. But I would definitely need to practice this more being high. Now I could be up here or I could be up here or I could be up here but this is like nearing the limits of how I’d wanna sound I think (10:48)”
* “Weirdly enough this sounds more androgenous to me. I guess it does have to do with tone of voice. Like here you have to enunciate down to get that bass quality. But when you’re up here you’re kind of just cutting off the ends of your sentences. Really it just sounds like any gay guy that I would think of. Like to get that constant volume at the ends of your sentences, you have to go up in tone.”
* “So it’s like 11 PM. It’s about an hour and a half since I took the edibles so this should be a good peak of the high moment. I like this voice thing we’re doing. I think I’m gonna try to emulate some voices I know. Let’s listen to Jonathan Carlin from J and Ben.”
* “Ok. I need a video that just Ben did.” **Me doing a horrible job trying to voice along to Dumbledore’s Big Plan**
* “Ok. I need something I can read but it works better when my eyes are closed. Or I could try to sing like this.”
* **Cue the pitfall of my existence**
* **Acapella-ing Thinking Out Loud for a min**
* “When I type, I feel like my left hand is like delayed”
* 14:54 - Death of a Bachelor (v pitchy)
* 18:20 - Sweet Caroline (not bad)
* 21:35 - Love Someone (p good)
* “So I feel like everyone thinks they sound good in their head when they sing. But it’s really how connected that image of your voice in your head sounds is to the sounds you’re actually making. So if that sounded good then I’m right and if it sounded shit then never mind. I should definitely do some musical stuff.”
* “Also I’m convinced that any singer/songwriter/artist of any kind, they’re 1000% high when they write stuff. Because it just, you have so much more inspiration. Like, things you’d never do, like you could sing up here and it’s kind of normal, and you’re not just thinking in your boring normal everyday voice.”
* 24:51 - Words fail (all over the place)
* 29:41 - ITAOT stuff
* “Anyway, the way I would describe this for not high me trying to emulate it is...so you kind of like push your chin/vocal cords out more. You definitely have to talk louder. You kind of feel like you’re talking more...no, that’s a pitch thing….ok so here’s the one I was at before. Definitely that gravelly voice comes from talking lower than is your range. You definitely gain more from just changing pitch elevation. Yeah.”
* 37:00 - Dead Girl Walking (eh its fine)
* 39:20 - Seventeen (not bad)
* 42:30 - Sincerely, Me (talking is p good, singing is ok as well)
* “Ok I definitely 1000% used to have a list of male solos. Disney...ugh why is this being weird…”
* 47:50 - Goodbye (not horrible)
* 50:10 - Something to Believe In (ok)
* 52:30 - Les Mis medley (pretty good)
* 57:22 - The Day I Got Expelled (ok)
* “While that’s playing, I just realized I never finish my water bottles. I always leave like, a sip, in case. In case I need it more than I do now.”
* “I’m gonna transcribe this tomorrow and do no homework. It’s gonna be awesome.”
* **I put headphones on and the quality of singing….changed**
* 1:03:20 - Speechless (its ok in terms of projection, just a bit off on pitch)
* “This is weird but I feel like a lot of the female songs I can sing better. If I just drop it an octave it's easier and more fitting to my range. So I’m gonna try some of those.”
* 1:06:00 - Wouldn’t Change A Thing (pitch is rlly going here...male pitch isn’t horrible just flat)
* **Lowkey I don’t remember singing some of these songs…**
* “I feel like I would play teenage boy roles until I get through that phase of like, my boyhood, then I would grow into more mature, I don’t know, older voices.”
* **Lol I’ve actually never heard myself burp
* “I’m gonna do some Rajiv Dhall now. I definitely aspired to his voice when I was younger”
* **Plot twist he took most of his songs down**
* “Ok. Tanner Patrick it is. Like, I like Alexander Stewart, but I don’t feel like I want to sound like Alexander Stewart”
* 1:11:08 - Royals (I clearly did not know the words but that seems to be a theme)
* 1:13:55 - Beautiful Now/Verge mashup (Not horrible)
* “Ok fourth water bottle.”
* 1:17:00 - Love Me Like You Do (good at times)
* 1:19:47 - Classic (A bit screamy and less sing-y but ok)
* 1:22:30 - American Dream (ok)
* **Why are my fingernails growing so fast I swear I just cut them**
* 1:24:30 - Lights Down Low (p good)
* 1:26:20 - Stand (meh didn’t rlly know the lyrics)
* 1:26:55 - I Want You Back (p good)
* 1:28:01 - Uptown Girl (p good)
* “Ok I think I wanted to sing like Blaine and I ended up on Sebastian”
* 1:30:15 - Baby It’s Cold Outside (oh god why)
* 1:31:47 - Don’t You Want Me (has potential, a bit pitchy)
* 1:34:16 - I Dreamed A Dream (flat)
* 1:36:30 - When Can I See You Again (ok, good voice quality, flat)
* 1:38:45 - Double Take (pretty good punk pop voice, flat, actually this is quite good)
* 1:40:50 - Better Together (you can hear the duality of singing low vs high)
* 1:43:16 - You Can Come to Me (p good, ya this is also v good)
* 1:45:50 - Don’t Look Down (not as good as some of the other A&A songs)
* 1:49:10 - Had me at Hello (shakier than I’d want, gets better higher)
* 1:50:50 - A Million Dreams (i think my throat was getting sore at this point lol, it's pretty good tho esp higher)
* **I think I need to lift my soft palate more**
* 1:53:49 - Mind (could be better if I knew the words lmao)
* 1:57:10 - Time (Definitely ‘softer’ sound cuz my voice was done)
* 2:00:10 - Marvin Gaye (Too gravelly/trying)
* 2:01:55 - Little Things (need to know the lyrics better)
* “All right. I’m now gonna summon my inner David Haungs and try to make a speech. So I wrote this, supposedly, 3 years ago. I do not remember it, but hopefully I can make it through. May it please the court. On June 9, tragedy struck Ballena Beach…… (2:08:30)”
* **I think I went to the bathroom here**
* “Yeah. So I know that I need to start getting better with the diet/exercise stuff cuz if I sound this way I wanna look the right way. But I need time. I need time to practice, which means I have to get high, and then to exercise...and I don’t have that time right now. I mean I’m definitely gonna do it over the summer, I kind of want more time to just explore me. Also, water bottle number 5. I’m gonna have some rice cakes. I need more paper plates.
* “Ok, I’m gonna pause this for now and just listen to some YouTube videos.”




APR 2 2021 – Docs
10:53 PM - 11:33 PM
Lately I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts. Fictional ones, like Pottermore and Seaweed Brain, as well as more educational ones like Sidenote and Chess podcasts. Also talk shows like Popcorn Culture, and I’m currently listening to HPMOR for the fourth (?) time. When I’m not listening to a podcast, I’m usually either listening to an audiobook or music. I try to listen to something all the time because 1) I get bored, and 2) it seems like a waste of time not to be learning something new all the time. Then I realized that perhaps I was just trying to hide from my thoughts. Listening to the same podcast, or the same YouTube videos isn’t really ‘productive’. 
I also feel like I need to unplug sometimes. Tonight I just laid in bed with no audio for five minutes, and it was the strangest feeling. Especially considering that that is how I used to spend every night in middle school and early high school. I remember the Green Day concerts I would pretend to give with my ripped CDs playing in the background. The mock fights I would stage that involved me saving the school from a mass shooter or rescuing my crush from a burning building. Lots of *whatever the extra calorie thing is called* too.
        I think that taking the time to just sit and think about your thoughts is important. There’s a quote: “A man who does nothing but think has nothing to think about but his own thoughts”. I think the opposite is true too though - if you spend all your time learning and consuming media without taking the time to process it, you aren’t really getting anything out of it. My eyes are closed as I type this, since I wanted to be as ‘disconnected’ as I could. I would write but I don’t really have a journal here, and typing is more efficient anyway. Sometimes I wonder if my obsession with efficiency is unhealthy…


I also think my parents might have been onto something by letting me only have 1 cookie or something. Maybe only making ice cream a treat every month. Because now, I’m just like fuck it lets eat the whole sleeve of cookies. I need some self-control. 


I miss thinking for the sake of thinking. The closest I get is probably in Ethics of VR just sitting there and thinking about simulation theory and what is reality and how do we know that everyone else isn’t just a figment of our imagination? I feel like I spend so much time on school stuff and academics that when I have a break I try to go as far away from that as possible. But maybe I should just think about stuff I like: chess theory, or how to solve a Rubix cube, or just the meaning of life.


A schedule I want to start having is:
* Wake up at 6
* Read maybe 20-30 pages
* Work out
* Shower
* Eat breakfast
* Do school work
* Play chess/ do other fun ~academic things
* Eat lunch
* More school
* Video games
* More school
* Dinner
* More school
* Free time
* Go to bed at 12


I think I need that regimented day. Lately I’ve just been waking up at random times and hoping it goes well. This summer I really need to get my shit together. I’m not doing a work or internship or anything - I’m taking this summer for me, which is also what I said I was going to do last summer and the whole year. I feel like I’ve kind of wasted this whole quarantine thing - I could have done so much self improvement. Instead I’ve slept, played Pokemon Go, and listened to podcasts on repeat. Alas. 
Some goals for the summer are”:
* Python
* Singing/voice
* Exercise/body
* Chess
* Reading


Did I mention I’m typing with my eyes closed? I also just realized I could dim the screen lol. I don’t have glasses on either, so I’m basically blind. 


I’ve been thinking about trans stuff a lot lately. Not as much the physical transition/dysphoria, but more of it as a social topic. There have been a lot of things that have made me be like ‘what?’, and I don’t know if I’ve just been really lucky or am just oblivious. I don’t feel like I’ve ever faced outright discrimination, and I had a relatively - no, actually fantastic - coming out experience. Most of my anxiety/trauma was self-induced, not societally induced. Sure, if society was very clear that everyone accepted trans people, that would have been one less thing to worry about, but most of my anxiety was from dysphoria anway. And as much as dysphoria sucks, I definitely DON’T want society to get rid of gender, because gender euphoria is the shit. I really see trans people as ‘binary’, which I know is kind of shitty, but it’s just my impression. Like when I think of someone who’s trans, I think of someone who has either started hormones and had surgery, or some closeted terrified kid just dreaming of the day he can do those things. I don’t really understand ‘trans’ people who say they don’t want hormones, or are comfortable using their birth pronouns as well. Like NB people definitely exist and are valid, but I’m not sure that they’re trans...I guess it’s just an umbrella term though? The other thing I have many questions about is with LGBT why LGB is lumped in with T. Like, gender and sexuality are two seperate things. Sometimes when I go to LGBT spaces or groups, people will assume I’m gay, and I’m like no I’m straight I’m just trans. (see: bisexual identity crisis). But yeah. Fun ramblings. 
The other thing that bothers me is that when I try to talk about/share my experience being trans, I feel shut out. The people who say that they’re all about empowering minority voices and sharing people’s stories don’t seem to want to hear mine, because it doesn’t fit into their perfect little tragic suppressed minority role. For all intents and purposes, my inner self is an average, maybe slightly less basic than average, white cis dude. Like that is my baseline personality. And sure, it’s been adapted by this smol body I have (proteus effect!) and the people I know, but I try not to let people change me. I don’t see anything wrong with who I am, and I’m not going to apologize for it. 
I also feel weird about being Asian sometimes - I’ve had plenty of thoughts about whether I’m a POC - short answer, no, but sometimes I’ll take it for the benefits hehehe. But when I hear about things like the Asian shooting in Georgia, I’m outraged, but I don’t feel like I’m particularly scared? Like yes, there are news stories about elderly Asians getting beat up,  but that’s partly because that’s what the social collective is focused on right now. Yesterday it was BLM, tomorrow it will be Jews, or gays, or whatever other minority has been attacked. Like, in high school people were like ah yes the Asian model minority you’re not oppressed what, what are you talking about affirmative action is bad, and now those same people are all like STOP ASIAN HATE!!! Like  yes, obviously people can change, but still...it’s a bit hypocritical. 
 not adopted -Anyway, my point was - when I see Asians getting murdered I feel the same level of fear as if it was a white person getting murdered (see: my identity as a white boy). Like sure, it’s a concern, but I’m just as concerned about being at a grocery store with a bunch of white people and getting shot by a mass shooter. It’s America, everyone is at some risk of violence, and I don’t feel like my risk is particularly elevated. Like, say there was a one in one hundred thousand chance I would be a victim of gun violence this year, just as an average American. Then say that being Asian tripled that change. Perhaps being trans doubles it. That’s not great, but also...it’s still a six in one hundred thousand chance. The odds are so slim that it doesn’t particularly affect me. 
        I guess my point is that I’m sick of people trying to promote me when one of my identities is ‘under attack’. I feel like I don’t strongly identify with my Asian or trans identities as  a particularly important part of me - if anything, I talk about being trans more just because I like to think and talk about gender stuff, and I feel like it gives me ‘power’ which is a WHOLE nother issue that I’m not even going to go into. And sure, it’s fun to meet other trans guys and be like yo how’s the beard growth going, or has your head voice come back, but I don't feel any particular affinity towards people just because they’re trans. 


Also in the musical affinity group today, Megan said something interesting - that sometimes people only do pronouns during introductions if they know that someone in the group is trans. That’s so weird, I’ve never even considered it. Like sure, in the last year it’s happened a lot more, but I assumed that was because I’m at a super liberal college now and also gender is a prominent topic among social media. Also, I’m introducing myself more than I have for the last like 4 years since everyone in high school pretty much knew each other. Now I wonder if there have ever been situations where people did pronouns just because I ‘looked’ trans or something. It’s  such an odd thought. And obviously, I have no way of seeing what they would do if I wasn’t there. Also highkey sometimes I forget to say my pronouns. Like when there’s name, pronouns, major, hometown, fun fact, etc., I’m usually so busy thinking about the fun fact that I forget about pronouns. Like now that I’ve been on T for nine months now, I kind of stopped worrying about perception. I assume that people will read me as male unless otherwise specified, and leave it at that.  And I’m usually too busy trying to think of a fun fact. I think there’s also a part of me that likes people not being explicitly told my gender and then getting it right anyways. It’s a good validation. And sure, people are always worried about messing up, but I think that the validation is worth the occasional misgendering. It’s like in Jake’s poll - cis people are ok with ‘they’, and binary trans people generally aren’t. I also just find it ood. The way I see it, he, she, and they are all distinct pronouns. You wouldn’t call a NB person she, because those aren’t their pronouns. Likewise, you shouldn’t call a guy they because that isn’t his pronoun. Like sure, off the cuff usage and singular vague is fine, but it’s very obvious when someone is doing it intentionally as someone’s actual pronouns and not as a general/generic term. 
Well, this is more than I’ve written probably since high school. Too bad I can’t write that VR paper this fast….


Oh also Jimmy! He’s like my first close male friend, and it’s really nice. Sometimes I wonder if there’s an awkward space though because I’m trans and he doesn’t want to be like insensitive. In my experience, girls have been more forward with asking questions, while guys are like oh ok. And I don’t know if it’s just because they’re more blanket accepting or because they’re too awkward to ask questions. I also have no idea what he’s like with other guys too, so he might just be a little awkward. Which like, I’m hella awkward, so no judgement, He reminds me of Josh a little, just in that they both like chess and are into that logical kind of thinking. Which I am too, but I also like emotional thinking every now and then. He’s also like hella motivated to do school work, while I barely have the motivation. I think it’ll definitely be fun rooming with him next year though. Sometimes with him and my other friends though, it feels like I’m always the one to make plans, or initiate hanging out or whatever. Idk why, if it’s just that I’m more social, or what, but it would be nice if someone asked me haha. 


There’s this weird feeling I can’t describe...with my brain. Like, when I’m intellectually stimulated, I feel more grounded, like my brain cells are physically closer together. If I’ve just played Pokemon Go for 3 hours and then listened to music, I feel like my brain is trying to achieve liftoff, and I can’t focus. Weirdly, I also get that rising feeling with weed, but with that it’s more like my whole brain is rising together, and I can still focus. WOW I’m looking back and I only made a handful of typing errors. I’ll go back through later and edit this and make it look sorta nice, but I’m doing a pretty good job ahaha. I almost want to keep typing, but I’m not sure what to talk about. I feel like there was something else. Ah well. Maybe I’ll edit this, but then I’ll probably end up on other websites.

So weed. I’m pretty sure I talked about this last time but I’ll talk about it again. I’m allllso typing with my eyes closed again. I want to make the formatting of this similar to last time but ‘ll do it later haha after I type. Wonder how many typoes I’ll make. I’m currently listening to an ADHD podcast about hyperfocus. It’s super interesting and relatable - they were talking about how when you’re doing something that you just feel like, such as cleaning your room, and then being told to do it and not wanting to anymore. Like once something has the connotation of being a chore, it loses its satisfaction. They’re also talking about how people with ADHD lack dopamine, and so they constantly seek it. Hm should I use we? I feel like that sounds very therapisty. I also feel like I say ‘I feel’ a lot...Anywayyy so people with ADHD seek dopamine from novel experiences. Such as a squirrel out the window or a noise. And hyperfocus happens when the thing you’re focused on provides you with enough dopamine (there’s a kind of name for it) that keeps you engaged. I feel like recently with weed, that provides a novel experience for everything. It’s like being a baby - everything is a new experience,


        Hey sorry I’m back I had to get my takeout. When they called and I answered the phone I feel like I have a very definitive ‘phone voice’, ya know? Also I think I might vape a little. It’s Friday after all. 


        Ok I took like 2 medium sized hits. I think that was the first time I haven’t coughed after vaping. I did drink water right after though so pro-tip. Now I’m typing with my eyes open idk why. Haha I can like see my fingers typing in my peripheral vision, but I’m not telling them what to do, they're just zoomin. Also I feel like being high can make you more aware of the pains in your body -- like I guess it just enhances sensation overall. But like I can still feel that my left rib cage/underarm is sore from the vaccine, even though it hasn’t been hurting when I’m sober.  
Omg my strawberry smoothie tastes so good. One of my favorite things about being high is the ‘4D vision’. That hasn’t kicked in yet, but I’m hoping soon. I should probably take my contacts out too. Idk if weed like dries out my eyes but who knows. Also how do you type the shrug emoji?? But anyway yeah, I’m always seeking dopamine. Like I love novel experiences, and even being outside. Like when I’m on a hike I won’t check my phone for hours, which never happens when I’m just inside on my computer or whatever. I really do think tech has changed us for the worse. 
Oh yo they have a YouTube? I should check that out. The ADHD podcasters that is. Infinite Quest. Anyway but yeah I don’t know why my voice deepens/clarifies on the phone. I wonder if it’s because my dad does that, and I’m modeling my masculinity after him. I was thinking about this the other day -- idk if i wrote about it last time -- but I feel like I model my masculinity after my dad and my femininity after my mom. But like...she doesn’t have that much of a personality? So I didn’t really have a female personality. I was kinda bland. But like my dad, I think of traits like smart, confident, outgoing, and that’s what I model myself after. To be fair, it could be that I just perceive women in general as bland and am projecting that onto my mom. But I did know how for a while before like ‘societal gender’ and shit.
        Ok I backtracked to the dopamine part of the podcast. So there’s something called tonic dopamine, that we lack. Also hehe I can feel my hands and arms getting heavy. It’s easier to crack my bones/elbows. It’s like I know what movement my body needs. I feel like it’s been a while since I hyperfocused on something new. Like now I just hyperfocus on pokemon go or hungry shark world. I wish I could be like when I used to just hyperfocus on random shit like a wikipedia hole, or cleaning my room, or idk just like running around randomly. I feel like high school and middle school dampened the part of me that just likes to randomly yeet around, but now that I’m in college I can do it again! No one is gonna yell at me if I’m just running around campus. 


I wonder if I didn’t do enough weed, I’m not like super focused. Like I’m not in the place where I feel uncomfy leaving the room. Like I could just go for a walk and probably be fine. I would but it’s super windy. Maybe in a few mins I’ll do another hit. It’s so funny how there’s like a shift from being a little high to a lot high. It’s not a continuous line it’s like a gradual slope and then a sharp yeet. Also why isn’t time stretching out. I feel like it’s flying by. It’s 7:20 now. I know I haven’t been typing for half an hour.
        I really want Adderall just to see what it’s like to be like...a normal person. I mean idk where to get any. But like. It would be nice to concentrate like a normal person. I feel like I’m always numbing myself so that my thoughts don’t just go like this. But this is how my brain used to be all the time. I would just have random trains of thought going 24/7. Especially at night. Like that’s why I couldn’t sleep, and I would do ninja moves for hours. But now I listen to potterless and play fucking bouncing balls all the time. Ugh. 
I should try like a tech cleanse or something. I would need someone to be around though. I want a mind palace. I don’t have the time to like practice tho? Maybe over the summer. 
I don’t know if I perceive the effects substances have on me. Like when I have sugar, I don’t really ‘notice’ that I’m more hyper. I don’t even know if I am. When I have caffeine, I usually get tired, but I feel like I only notice that because it’s against the effect I’m expecting. Like instead of 2 vs 0 it's 2 vs -2. 


I hope that cs doesn’t lose it’s novelty. I like it because it’s like solving a new problem each time. But what if I get bored? Oh noooo. Like they were just talking about this on the podcast, how they fear someone commenting on something they’re hyperfocused on, because that ruins it. Like if I’m hyperfocused on cleaning or doing chores or working out, I can’t have anyone say anything, because then it ruins it. This happened sooo much when I was younger.
        They’re now talking about anticipating which things you’re going to hyperfocus on rather than weird things that just pop up. What things do I anticipate? Cleaning, I guess. Sometimes just doing tasks. This strawberry smoothie is super good. Sometimes I can’t remember if I’ve already typed something haha. Like ADHD and short term memory is such a thing. Like things just go right out my brain once I put them in. But yeah this’ll be interesting to read tomorrow. But thoughts are so fresh that I don’t know if I passively thought them or thought them and then typed them. I’m trying to just type things as I think them, but my speed of thinking is outpacing my typing speed. 
        Wait this is beautiful. She just said that as someone who doesn’t normally feel joy, hyperfocus allows her to feel joy. I feel like when ADHD people do things like have stupid insta posts or something, not-ADHD people assume they’re doing it in one mindframe (like if they were to pretend to be ADHD the things they would do) vs why the ADHD people actually do it. Like I feel like people don’t truly understand that other people think in different ways. Like you truly do think about things differently, such that you can’t understand at all what it feels like to be someone else. Then I wonder if it’s just me who doesn’t understand this / hasn’t thought about it before, and everyone else is like well duh. 


THIS. He’s talking about how it feels like you brush your teeth one morning, and then the next morning it’s like welp i guess I’m doing this again. But like I’ll play hungry shark world for half an hour, and then ten minutes later I’ll want to do it again. Like I waste so much time playing mobile games just to sate that desire for dopamine. I think something like sex or masturbation raises your dopamine levels so much that then you can function for a bit after, because it like compensates. But something like video games just temporarily raises it, so that after you’re bored again. 
Also I wonder what would happen if I only listened to podcasts/music like when brushing my teeth or in the shower. It would make it more special and then when I’m doing homework I would have to do it without a podcast. Then I’d be more motivated to get to my podcasts. I feel like sometimes I feel pressured by the time limits of being high to like make the most of it. Ya know? Like I don’t usually feel that way about free time, since I know I can kind of sneak blocks in throughout the day. But being high is a 3-4 hour thing at least, so I can’t just randomly do it during the day. 
        Wow I’ve already typed like 2.5 pages, wish I was this productive with actual school work LMAO. I think that time accommodations for ADHD would be really bad. Bc I know I’ll take the given amount of time, so if I have extra time I’ll just procrastinate more. I also miss the classroom setting where my competitiveness would help me finish faster. But yeah, time pressure is the real reason I get anything done. “Shame and embarrassment are the death of improvement”. I’ve been having really really realistic dreams, sometimes to the point that I can’t tell if something really happened or happened in real life. The worst things are things like text messages / looking at my phone. Since it’s like an observation rather than something I’m physically doing, I feel like it’s stored the same way in my memory. But like, sometimes when I’m on the verge of consciousness and my phone alarm is going off, I’ll think I’m turning the alarm off, but I’m still asleep and I need to realize like hi I have a body with an arm and that arm is not moving and that will snap me back to the real world a bit.


        “My ADHD and depression also need to shower. And if they’re inside me, then I’ll shower and they’ll shower and it’s like we’re working together”.
        “Be nice to your depression. Don’t try to murder it.”
        Facility. Facil. Easy. Turn your spaces into facilities, places where things get done. 
Think about why processes are difficult (the minutia). EX. I don’t like getting up because the bed is warm, so then you wear warm clothes so you’re still warm.
Are they saying “me zone plus”?


I took another hit but not really feeling it. I mean I kind of felt it just now ahaha nice timing. The “Just Noticeable Difference”? Anyway, I wonder if I always hyperfocus on Pokemon or if I only do Pokemon when I want to so it works that way. I would have to try sorting Pokemon when I’m not in the mood and see if I end up hyperfocusing anyway.

Note, the laptop computer is like 14 mins ahead, so it’s unreliable. My mouth is really dry. I took 3 small puffs of the ‘good’ weed, and I think it’s definitely stronger than the other one. A rule, START SMALL WITH UNKNOWN STRAINS. You can always go up and you need a baseline. Worst case, you just spend a few days barely high all day. Wow I’m seeing a green/pink stripe in the baseline of my  vision where the laptop hinge is. I’ve kind of been slacking on this scientific weed stuff. I’ve been trying to find a ‘good’ dosage, but I just keep doing the same amounts so uh oops. Bad science boy. It’s like I forget the effects of weed when sober, so I’m like ah yeah 2 hits can’t PoSSibLy be that much right?? And then it is. I feel like a cool breeze on my face would feel good. And like grounding.
I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about hypochondriac stuff while high. Mostly not being able to breathe, and heart rate. Assuming because those are the areas affected by smoking. But when I got my edible dose down last week (⅓ of a square), my chest still felt a bit tight, so maybe I have unconscious anxieties about those things. Could explain why I’m bad at swimming? Don’t worry about indenting paragraphs I can fix it when I go back and edit.


I have SO many books. SO many. I literally have a whole shelf of books I haven’t read!! Yet I keep rereading old serieses like Alex Rider and Michael Vey. I wonder if I like them because during my ‘first puberty’ they helped me develop a sense of masculinity? But now during my second puberty, instead of reinforcing my masculinity, I should read like smart people books and then when I’m done I’ll be masculine AND smart. 


I can’t go to therapy or anything and get ADHD treatment now LOL because apparently that’s a big disqualifier for the military, so now I’ll never be diagnosed and just have that sliver of doubt in my mind that I’m making it up. I feel so petty not changing my gender yet so I can have the easier PFT standards but like...it wouldn’t be fair, I’m not a 6’0 guy with muscles and no fat who can just sprint around. Then again, life isn’t fair, and even if I’m “a salmon swimming upstream”, I still have to be just as good as everyone swimming downstream. Lol if that was an actual metaphor, like 90% of people wouldn’t even be swimming they’d just be letting the water carry them along. Like the people who stand on an escalator versus walking up it. 


I think things I should buy should be ones I have no qualms about buying. Like the HP sticker book or Pokemon magazine. Not like some books I’ve bought and felt uncomfy spending the money but being like fuck it it’s a good deal. Like when I buy food I never rlly feel upset about spending the money, so I know it was a good purchase.


So I kind of envision two possible futures. One is where I follow my subconscious desires and go into the military, give up drugs for 4 to 20 years, and serve in the ‘acceptable’ role. The other is that I try to get a job in CS to sustain myself, spend my nights high, and try to become an author/ content creator creating relatable content to people who are high, and trying to develop some system of gradually heightening peoples’ senses in a way that they can scientifically control it. OR measure peoples’ CB1 levels and find a way to put everyone on the same level so that we all perceive the world the same and everyone would like each other. Of course first I’d have to make sure that people on the same level did like each other….Maybe there’s some kind of like most desirable gap or something. 


This sticker book is so fucking satisfying. BTW my times here are based on real time not the laptop’s fucked up clock. Currently 13:38. Gotta get into that military time! Hm I should change my FitBit to show a 24 hour clock instead of 12. Hang on. 
OK apparently my computer was like 2 MONTHS off and the time just happened to be similar. It was actually in the 1 AMs…..Even tho the computer shows AM/PM AND the date, which I ignored because the most variable unit of measurement was close enough. Rip. Clock adjusting accomplished. 


OK do Uber drivers know that we all see their profile pic when we get assigned to them? Like god people take a decent selfie. 


I feel more like an adult now than ever. 


I think I sunburned my shoulders yesterday. Like I didn’t know I could burn, and also why JUST my shoulders?? Maybe bc I scratched them?


I think milk tastes good high. I first smoked at 13:00. So it’s been like an hour now. Still not at a “I could drive” point, but I def could in like 2 hours. I think listening to music high is better than podcasts because then it leaves my brain more room to think. Like the point of weed isn’t to live the same way I usually do. It’s to let my heightened state guide me to activities that I wouldn’t usually do like type and do stickers. It’s to become better and less dependent on tech. I think the only things I should be able to do are play music, record pictures/video, and type/google. No games or social media or incoming content other than music. Man. The one regret about Air Force is no weed. I’m hungry. Mitsubaaaaa come here. Wait damn. I legit thought I ordered Chipotle. Like I was thinking about the guac. Ergh. 


I think I might like the thing that comes to mind second more because then it can be the “counter argument” and I’m a devil’s advocate. Or else I’m a devil’s advocate because my mind automatically thinks of the thing I want second and I learned to pick that because when I pick the first thing I’m not as happy.
Maybe I like adrenaline because then I’m on the same mental level as normal people. Like if a crisis were to occur now, I’m sure I wouldn’t be able to handle it as well as I can when I’m sober. Like maybe me high+danger is normal people+danger, and that’s why people freeze. 
Wtf why do I have so much acne?? Like I thought it was better than normal this morning, but now it looks worse than normal. Grrrr.

        I’m back home from the goat farm lmao. It was also about a month ago that I was getting my drains taken out from top surgery. Now that I know how much physical/mental discomfort there can be, I feel like I can more appreciate working out and being productive. I wonder if people really like things they do a lot because of Stockholm syndrome lmao. Like I type maybe once every couple of weeks but if I did it every day I would probably really like it lol. Also exercising while high is really good, like stretching? I’m gonna lift weights after this, and when I’m in better shape, probably run high. 
Ok when I’m high I’m way more aware of how much less my body feels ‘good’, like I feel my right shoulder tightness and how taking a full breath isn’t as clean, and how my right leg is kind of weird. I’m also more aware of my mental persona - I’m not as masculine as I’d like to be - that is, while sober I don’t think masculinely enough, so when I’m high it’s not instinctual. I think that how you think high is your default, so it's a good way to see if the changes you’re making in your everyday life are kicking in.
        
I think listening to classical music while lifting weights would be cool, and maybe more effective because you’re imagining yourself lifting them more slowly, rather than fast and choppy like with rap.
        One hit of the vape is good for productivity. I think two is more like watch a movie and fall asleep. Three is….leg shaking lol. The dispensary weed was really good in terms of clarity, like I could function like a normal human. I don’t know if it was also weaker? The only time I really got the racing thoughts was when I did 4 hits before those cars started racing lol. Even when I did 6 the last night I didn’t really get it, and that’s after I had to pour water on the joint the night before lmao. I guess I’d need to try greening out on dispensary weed to see if it’s possible.


        So the farm was quite a time. It made me realize that yes, I can do physical work, and get up early, and go without a lot of food. Food deprivation also makes it easier to eat foods you don’t love because you’re pretty much desperate for anything. My sense of time also changed - waking up at 6 and then eating breakfast at 8:30 was great because you feel like you’ve done so much and it’s still only like 9. Then you can take a nap until 12, wake up, and chill again. I feel like I’m always counting down the hours until dinner. Like right now it’s 12:50. So if we’re going to eat dinner at 1830, I’m like ok I have like 5 hours and 40 minutes left today. Which is obviously ridiculous since I have like 4 or 5 more hours after dinner. By not having a sit down dinner at the farm I think my perspective was pushed back to oh I have 10 hours until I go to bed at 2300. Like having a sit down dinner is fine, but missing it also has to be fine because then it really opens up that block of time. So I guess today no napping because you “missed” it by just sleeping through the whole time lol. 
I have to finish washing my stuff, like my FitBit and PowerBeats. I can’t believe my clothes still smell like goat. I want to go to Kohls and get new sneakers, maybe white ones. I also want white shorts but that’ll have to wait until I lose weight lol. Like it’s easier to be motivated to lose weight when high because your body is consciously affecting your self-perception rather than when you’re sober and it’s just kind of in the background and you can ignore it. Like right now, I can’t ignore it lmao. If I stay in this mindset, I could have a really productive summer in terms of fitness and health. 
I also have to be able to drink BCAAs/ pre workouts too so I better get used to not great tastes haha. I think the rule is to not eat anything you want until after dinner. Because then even if you eat a lot, it’s like you won’t eat that much because you’re full. Like intermittent fasting but for sweets. And then eventually you can cut down there. Now that I have time during the day, I should be going to bed early. Like, I used to stay up late to play on my phone because that was the only time I had to do it. But now I could just hang out all day, and then go to bed at like 2100 or something. I want my default to be thinking in military time and then having to convert it to civilian time rather than vice versa lol. I think I vaped at like 1200. Does the military never use colons in time? I definitely have to go back and format these later lol.

Although my philosophy is that content can be separated from its creator, I don’t know if I trust my brain to make that divide. Like with Harry Potter I ignore JK Rowling’s transphobia because I don’t want to taint my perception of something that was such an integral part of my childhood and honestly personal development. I avoid reading her tweets or engaging in conversations about her because I just kind of want to bury my head in the sand and keep Harry Potter as this pure thing in my mind.


I weeded the garden today (weeded lmao). I didn’t mind it, like I don’t mind doing things that I like or at least don’t not enjoy. Like I could do physical work. I just mind boring stuff like cleaning certain things, or things where you have to come back like laundry. I could probably mow the lawn lol, I don’t think I’d mind it.
I took 2 small hits instead of 1 really long one. I could probably do another. 


I like tank tops, they make me feel muscley and masculine haha. Also idk why I’m starting new lines for everything usually I just type blocks.


I’m tired from weeding lol even though I got up at like 12. I don’t know if my problem with fitness is strength or just being tired lol. Like when I was weeding my heart rate wasn’t super high or anything but my legs were just so tired. Like when I would bend down to pull a weed my right leg was shaking the way my arms do when benching. 
Maybe I just need to practice staying awake all day lmfao. Like in high school I was sleeping 5 hours a night. Maybe I should get into the habit of 7-8 rather than fricking 12. I also need to copy my phone notes into a google doc. Today was supposed to be a rest day from the gym, but I weeded for 90 mins so that was a workout haha. 
I changed my calorie goal to 1500 from 1200. I wasn’t hitting 1200 almost every day anyway, and according to the mayo clinic maintenance calorie calculator, I need 1800 calories (male) and 1700 (female). I’m not sure which to use, being on t and all. So I figure if I'm eating 1500, and burning an extra 300-400 during my workouts, I’m still hitting the 500 calorie deficit daily (1 pound / week). 
LukeNate on tiktok has been cool to watch bc he built decent muscles even before t and now on t it looks great. I realized I kind of wasted the first year on t by just being passive and letting it change my voice. Which is fine, but to really benefit I realized I still have to actively work on changing my body, and let t help. 


I’m going to add journaling to the daily schedule I made for myself in evernote. Oh also I need to type up my written journal from the other day. I’m in like a focused high, not a high high which is good. I’m gonna take a speed typing test brb. Ok I got an 83 on typingtest.com but I don’t think it’s the one I’ve used before. I can’t find the other one though. I’ve broken 100 before though. Ok I took it again and got 104….maybe I’m just not used to typing since I haven’t done it in a while as compared to during the year when I was typing all the time lol. And typingtest.com is the one I’ve used, I guess they redesigned the site. 


Speaking of which...I should update my personal website. It's just like in limbo right now lol. I also need to get my sleep schedule on track - I think once I do it for a couple of days it should be okay. Then again on the farm it just got harder every day… But hopefully I can go to bed earlier tonight since I’m tired. I remember how it felt in the airport Saturday morning...I thought I was just going to like pass out haha. Also is the search bar blue it looks like it has a blue highlight. Anywayyy that was legit the first time since high school that I’ve been that tired. It wasn’t the same as physical exhaustion though, it was more mental. I was also starving...I also need to transcribe my audio grr. Maybe later I’ll just have the same amount and then type all night. Which is kind of what I’m doing now...ok I’m gonna go shower so I can work tonight. 


I love how this self-improvement is like my full time job. I need it though, because I wasted most of my teenage years being depressed and stuff because I was trying to think like a girl. Like being high, it’s so clear to me that I think like a boy and that I’m just kind of chilling with a self perception of a guy. All the physical changes I make (clothes, hair dying) are just trying to match my image to my internal self perception as it would be represented externally in society. GO SHOWER.


21:24
Same day. I think eating more at meal times is good because then you don’t want to snack later on. Also typing, I can see some veins on my hands yay. I genuinely have no idea what I wrote earlier versus just thought and/or texted. So if I didn’t say it yet, I like the way I look in tank tops. I’m pretty sure I did type it though. So I’m just going to do some formatting/transcribing tonight. I had a drink, and I like this. It kind of calmed the racing thoughts from being high so now I can just chill and work. 


If you tape audio, don’t delete dead space because you need to know what time it was at a current point. Maybe also update the time at some points. Ok I’m gonna go through my iPhone “thoughts” now. I’m considering finishing my Celsius, but I probably don’t need caffeine on top of this lmao. Maybe I should make a new doc every time but copy them all into a big one for searching purposes. 


Ok I finished typing the phone thoughts. I might make this the phone thought document and transfer the journal or vice versa. Probably transfer the phone thoughts to a new doc actually. This is like the OG, and it’s for longer things so I can see how my mindset has changed over time, rather than just random ideas/questions. I think that setting my intentions for the next day is good. Like last night, I wrote that I was going to do this work, and now I’m doing it. So my intentions for tomorrow are to get up let’s say before 10:00, go to the gym and do weights for at least 45 mins, run .75 miles, and then write about the farm at night. You can get a smoothie since it’s Friday, but no sweets until after dinner.


Also sitting on the floor hurts my butt, maybe I should stop doing it lol. Wow my computer battery really sucks, all I’ve been doing is typing and it’s already at 36%...I guess I’m also recording though. I could stop since I’m not singing or saying anything. I need to look more into if singing encourages more thoughts or hinders them. I guess I can switch to my backup. I’m also trying to make my room more minimalist. I want to bring the keyboard up here though.


I can’t believe I’ve been out of school for 2 months. I have to go back in 6 weeks that’s actually hella depressing. I feel like I’ve wasted time working on myself. I still have time though. I also want to read more.


Some ToDos from my phone: clean photo storage, close tabs, name change. Also finish weeding the garden tomorrow. I think a new rule should be read last night's thoughts the next morning. Ok I need to move the ‘not high’ thoughts to my random thoughts doc so basically I’m going to have 3 working thoughts docs, 4 if I do a dream one. 
Ok so there is going to be a master doc which should be a compilation of all the numbered files. Then there is the phone thoughts doc which is NOT on the master doc. Anything can be found either on the master doc or the phone thoughts doc. The phone thoughts doc is also for short thoughts that were typed lol

Alright this one is a little different. I’m more aware of my body than with the blueberry one. I also feel like the inside of my brain is hot. I can hear my heartbeat through the headphones and just noticed my mouth is super dry. Maybe this one is more sativa?
Wow I’m listening to Welcome to the Internet by Bo Burnham. I can really hear the sounds. It’s the BeatSaber version though so that could be the BeatSabers noise. This is more like the smoking strain I have from at home, I think. And Blueberry is more like the Jack Herer. Go back and make all the capitalization of strains even (make them capital).
This is good, bc it’s different from the others so it feels novel. I think doing the same one nights in a row makes it less special.
I have my mirror on the desk, and it’s shaking up and down as I type out of the corner of my eye. I can only see the corner of my head in it, so at first I thought that my head was just bouncing up and down as I typed lmao.
I know I was thinking I want to do 2 squares on my bday but honestly that’s not even like...fun. I would have to go through unpleasant time first. Where I am right now is good. So instead of doing more at night maybe I’ll just chill like this all day lol. It’s good for relaxing.
Also fuck my audiotonic was still recording from LAST NIGHT. I’m starting a new one. (at 22:01)
22:15
        Hm it seems like longer than 20 minutes lol maybe I’ll have to dispute what I said on the recording. Orrr it’s short term memory that’s affected too. I think that’s more likely. So I guess I can type while I’m recording singing. But both stop the singing anyway….But anyway! My theory on development with dysphoria and just identity is that our personality is set on a path at a young age, like maybe by the time I was 8 or 9 my destiny as someone who wants to perform/be a creator was set. And then life got in the way, and my brain didn’t develop the way my personality was expecting so now there’s like a disconnect. Like I grew up to not see the world as high as maybe most singers, so that skill isn’t there for me. 
        Pay attention to how your mouth is moving while sitting, maybe close eyes and hand on chest. It’s really hard to sing and type maybe this is the multitasking thing people talk about, maybe I just switch tasks really really fast and now that my perception is slowed I’m noticing the switching? That still shouldn’t affect ability though…
Rather than emulating the artist, emulate what you think you should sound like singing it
What if I just switch to clinical and then I can spend my work time thinking about this stuff, and then really hash it out at home. It would be cool to do like me at 18 vs 22 or whatever and show how much more muscley/better at singing I am and market a program to change your life too. No Air Force though then….it’s like I could do Air Force (which I want) but have to do compsci, or I could do what I want and do clinical as a backup. I don’t know why I want to double minor lol, like the whole point is to be less academically strained. Maybe compsci as a minor since I’m like 60% of the way there but that’s it. No extra minor lol. I could honestly probably graduate in 3 years...I should do at least some undergraduate research, if not for grad school at least to have done it.
A good first date question would be “how do you see the world” or like “what is your base principle” where mine would be trying to maintain neutrality in political situations. In personal situations, I would say “survival with a bit of protection”.
I like redheads lol idk why they get hated on. I think someone’s profession is a better reflection of their personality than their major. Assuming they picked their profession because they like it…
23:09
Being in the dark makes me more high...talking makes me less
I think I might do another. It’s been an hour and a half. How did I look and it was 20 mins and now I’m looking and it’s 90??


Note: I took 2 short and 1 medium hits before going to bed and falling asleep. 7/18.

        I feel a little buzzed like ringing in the ears, a bit more aware of my body/nose/glasses. When I look at things I can see a bit of a yellow/blue/pink outline but I’m not sure if I’m imagining it haha. It didn’t taste as bad this time, I wonder why. My birthday flew by, and today I feel like I understood some of my mindset of birthdays from being a kid like wanting everything to be perfect and thinking it sets the next year.

        I feel couch locked it’s really starting to hit. I just listened to 8D music with headphones and it was kinda uncomfy I def see how it could be triggering to autistic kids. Listen to stuff at half speed. My room is a spaceship. With the lights on the white walls look plastic. Figure out which Christian/Tom song you were trying to find. Also yes you’re getting hyper focused make sure it’s on the right things. 4D vision. Fuck I forgot what I came here to type oh right get lights for the dorm like Tom and/or Niko Katsoyushi. You need to have an older mindset when you’re sober.


Transcription


Part 1
        Hello, it is I. It’s currently 23:14 on July 20, 2021. I just moved the music to the Kindle so I can record on my phone.


Part 2
        Listening to myself talk sounds a little strange. I hope it’s from my perception and not because my talking is messed up cause I need to be able to transcribe this tomorrow. Here’s Piplup on my bed, I’m shirtless. Earlier I thought my room was like a Star Wars spaceship because of the red and green lights. Then when I turned the lights on the white walls looked plasticky. When I move I feel like I’m moving in slow motion. *inaudible* I kind of wish I showered before this. It’s fine. It’s been an hour, so I figure I’m near the peak but I’m not seeing things through a television like I did last time. I really hope I don’t fall asleep early. I understand that eating might be weird because even rubbing my hand against my face feels weird. There’s this pain in like my left middle finger middle knuckle. I feel like an adult back in my childhood home. Like when Alex and Kara in Supergirl go back to visit, and I’m just like chilling with Piplup reminiscing about the good old days. There’s definitely more of a come up here I feel like. Small human (?). *inaudible* I feel like I’ve always felt like technology touching my body doesn’t feel right. It sends weird vibes, like I need it separate, not part of me. Here, Piplup can hold it. If I just am...well I don’t know if I’m being influenced by the music now. There’s some like tic in my left eyebrow or something. Even if I think I’m laying still, something’s moving. 
I think I’m taking shadows and ambiguous things and shaping them into what you want to see because the drugs will make you more open to suggestion, make you more suggestible, make you more naive I guess, more vulnerable. And then I mean you can either let whatever comes to mind come to mind like sometimes when I close my eyes I just see the words or the visuals like now I see like leaves kind of in the shape of a ferris wheel but you know you can control it too if you want to. It would be nice to be in nature right now, but I’m happy here with Piplup. Yeah I do wish I took a shower though because being sticky is kind of uncomfortable. I’m worried I’m getting Piplup all greasy. Peep. Well maybe he can have a steam bath tomorrow. I should take a bath tomorrow, I haven’t taken a bath in like years. And now I’m getting to the point where I hear my voice sounding gay, so yeah I’m really starting to hear my voice so this would be a good time to sing if I wanted to do that. *Sings Stars from Les Mis*. 


Part 3
        Why is my nose so itchy? I also want to do stuff. My phone battery is at 69%. Yeah I sound super gay right now and I just did some singing on Snapchat that I saved on like google photos or whatever. Um yeah so Piplup. Piplup, what’s a good voice level for Piplup I feel like this is good. Maybe this is a better thing to do because right now I just kind of want to enjoy visual effects like looking at the sheet and the blanket they just look really cool with all the stripes. Everything looks so smooth. *inaudible* Piplup is so soft. His eyes when I have my ear against my skin like this I can like hear myself talking through my body. Like idk you know, I can hear myself, I can hear it, I can hear sound like it’s so weird. Cuz my ear is pressed to my body, but is the sound reverberating through my whole body, I thought it’s coming from my mouth? Woah what if I found a plothole in the universe? Piplup, don’t push me off the bed. When I type this up, I don’t know if it’s gonna accurately convey my mood right now. I wonder if I could be 19 I should start being like the man of the house, the alpha dog. Yeah I’m an alpha, I’m a fucking power alpha, come and ride me baby. Sex would feel so good right now. *changes music* I feel like I look really happy. Is Anchor still recording? Ok good. Like when I smile it looks more natural, more pulling the right side back. I’m probably a bit self obsessed, I just stare in the mirror every time I do this. But it’s so interesting to see what I look like, like really. The acne and flab are the two main issues, muscles would be good too. Your goal should just be so that you can be relaxed and still look good. Like you can stupidly dance around and still be attractive when you’re not paying attention to that. So you work out and eat less weird stuff and then you just vibe. That should translate into your 24/7 life. This tan looks so fucking weird. I think my happy trail has gotten thicker. Like my shoulders are really bulky like even if I just put my arm up and don’t flex my shoulder still looks big. Obviously you can’t do this in the Air Force but hopefully by then you’ll be confident enough and ready so that you can pursue the *inaudible* that you want to. There’s like fucking dead skin all over my face. 


Part 4
        When I look in the mirror I can see the guy that I want to be, and I can see how I’m getting there, but I also realize that I’m not there yet. You still need a lot of work, but you’ll get there. I feel like when I take photos I take them of the left side of my face cuz it looks better cut off but also like the two sides of my face look fine on their own but together they look so weird. Also this definitely isn’t as intense as last time because last time I looking at life like it was through a fucking movie screen. Like I could just be in nature chilling and looking at the stars and I really want someone to cuddle with. I burned 2000 calories, what’s it from? It’s not like I worked out. Is it from my walk, what the fuck, I’m so confused does it think I was burning calories while I was out walking around? Unless being high makes you burn calories because it elevates your heart rate?


Part 5
        If you open the camera app it ends the recording, so use snapchat. Historically eating has not gone well, but *inaudible* I got this at the Seattle Zoo like 2, no 3 weeks ago. Maybe exactly 3 weeks ago? If you want to attract the vibes, you have to put out the vibes. This looks like a candy cane but I know that it’s not. *eats root beer candy stick*. I think it’s good because I can just sit here and lick this because swallowing might be a challenge right now. Yeah this isn’t too fun. I’ll stick to licking, no chewing no biting. I want to get back to a place where I like licking things rather than like chewing them for the aesthetic of chewing and swallowing, then I wouldn’t eat as much and I could lose weight. 


Part 6
        I feel like my room at home is very similar to my dorm room last year. Like I’m sitting here against the bed and I can just see the bed with the white wall in the background and it gives me Packard vibes. My tongue feels abnormal (?). My legs look *inaudible*. My left and right eyes maybe they like process things at different speeds? I might try eating jelly again later because that was really good last time. Also hold the phone up when you speak. I haven’t been thirsty this whole time. Maybe it’s cause I’ve been drinking enough water during the day. The fact that I feel good now might be a tribute to the fact that I’ve been taking care of my physical self. Like your physical self needs to be in shape for your mental self to flourish. 


Part 7
        I need to go on TikTok to find Christian and Tom’s song that goes *humming*


Part 8
        Well, have fun checking your TikTok drafts tomorrow. The last one I just got distracted looking in the mirror. *singing Bezos I* This shirt’s a little v-necky but otherwise it looks pretty good. I’m gonna try some other shirts on. Alright I’m gonna go sailboat shirt. I’ve had it less than a month, maybe a little over a month, but it already feels like such a classic. Muscles *inaudible*. Yeah I’m definitely still tripping. Why is it just hitting now it’s literally been over 2 hours, hasn’t it? I swear to god it’s been over 2 hours. Yeah it has. Maybe electronics distracted me? Like TikTok, that’s a distraction. *singing Welcome to the Internet* 


Part 9
        I should look down every once in a while. I feel like you don’t really notice your body. Like I’m a lot tanner but I don’t really pay attention to that. I’ve got a little bit of the *inaudible* that I’ll have to keep working on. I’m assuming no one’s liked my post because it’s 1 in the morning and not because it sucks. I should get my charger. *goes downstairs* I don’t know what to listen to, I kind of want to play Lego Harry Potter.

Started 23:00. It is currently 23:39. So basically a 2 day t break reset my tolerance lmao. I had one medium hit and am out of it. But like this is the way I used to think high. So is it like as I come off of it (mentally or physically) I slowly get less high and I don’t notice it but it happens. But now that I’m back to how I normally think, (as a person or being sober), like is being high a state my goal is to be high and aware without drugs, the high is intense again. I’m in a place where sex feels good because my imagination would be able to go into overdrive and connect my mental image with my physical reality. If you think higher you learn to listen to your intuition more since things don’t really make as much sense

You are a man. An adult man. Not a boy, not a child. You are evolving from Theo to Theseus. Physically, mentally, emotionally. You have self control, and can fight impulses to eat junk food. You can wake up early, exercise, and study. Last week, you lost almost 5 pounds, and then proceeded to gain it back by binging on desserts. Those first few days are the hardest - it's when the temptations are strongest, especially since it was the day after your testosterone shot. But if you push through, you WILL be rewarded. Success is made from habits, not single occurrences. You've got this. Think of the man you want to be. An Air Force officer on par with the guys from Harvard and MIT that you've met. A leader, who is respected for his work ethic and personal development. Someone who gives 110% all the time, even when no one is watching. Someone who can kill the PT test in his sleep, because he's trained for so much more.

So I had sex with a guy for the first time tonight. Well. “Sex”. They’re actually nonbinary but lowkey I’m too lazy to do the mental work for that. Like for people I’ll see regularly, or that I don’t have a particularly strong view of gender about, I’ll put in the work to actively think of them as nonbinary, but for strangers I kind of just will think about them in the way that comes naturally, and it’s more natural for me to think of Sam as a guy so I’ll just use ‘he’. Anywayyyy it was fine like lowkey it went in but didn’t rlly stay in and like when he went too deep it hurt. Like honestly I’d probably prefer a guy with a smaller dick lol.
So like I lowkey feel guilty about a hookup but I also hate that I feel guilty about it because like liberal culture says that normal culture should make you feel guilty about it and like that it’s ok, but I also hate liberal culture, so I don’t want to be ok with feeling guilty. Like honestly I think liberal culture just points out all the things about mainstream culture that I try to ignore, like JK Rowling and Harry Potter. I also feel like people just generally hate culture, maybe because it makes them feel less individual, like throughout history teenagers have always hated authority, whatever that authority was. And since I’ve just grown up so immersed in liberal culture, that’s what I hate, even though a lot of kids raised in more mainstream/conservative culture would love the environment I’m in.
I also don’t like that I can’t be my masculine self without that implicitly being tied to like being sexual, like if I was a tall guy with a loud voice I could just be more reserved and it would be ok, but since I’m smaller, I have to show people my personality with what I say since it doesn’t really match how I look, and sometimes I have to say things that I might not normally say so that people will perceive me the way I want them to.
And like culturally we’re supposed to think that sex with girls is good and sex with guys is bad which is super weird, but I guess that’s how it is. Like if I hooked up with someone with a vagina, it’d be fine. Although maybe I just don’t like sex that much? Idk like I’ll cum but it’s not as good as just masturbating. 
Also I don’t like liberal culture like I wouldn’t want it to completely immerse society because I think it’s really toxic. Like it’s so revolved around hating specific groups of people (the rich, white people, straight people, etc) like I understand that that’s the ‘majority’ or whatever but if this culture ever did permeate everyday life, then like liberal gay people would be the majority or in power and like straight white guys would be super oppressed. 
I feel like it would be easier if I was less masculine or more like some other trans guys I know (like ‘soft’ bois) but I’m just not and I don’t want to conform to that lol. Like I wanna be a masculine sporty guy (kinda like Joe) but also be able to hang out with girls and not have them like hate me. 
Like I guess I understand that people who grew up in a conservative environment hate guys or whatever, but on that same idea, they should understand that I hate people who hate guys.
And when people want to “talk about politics” they just mean they want to sit around with a bunch of people who think the way they do and like complain about whatever relevant issues they have in common. Like it isn’t productive discourse at all.
I don’t remember which psych paper it was but at some point I read about like the 8 midlife crises people have or something and I think it’s true, like I think everyone has the same general arc in that they like fight against the system, and look for things they lacked in childhood, etc. It would be cool to be a therapist just to see how people’s journeys vary and stuff, and help them work through that stuff.
The things I like to do high are not the things I like to do sober, so I need to plan my highs around those things. Like high I like to sing, act, eat, masturbate, listen to music, watch movies, etc. Sober I like to work out, listen to podcasts, study, listen to audiobooks.




Also I think I like sugary drinks like slushies better than cookies or cake because they last longer even if it’s the same number of calories. Smoothie King smoothies are amazing because they’re like pure protein, low calories, taste good, and last a long time. 
I’m gonna try to write all my thoughts from the walk back before I think about anything new lol.


What do the shapes mean in squid games? Also when they say that people always pick the middle numbers then does that imply that there have been other games? Like do the rich people go around the world watching these all the time?
Ayy I was right it goes Left-Right-Right
Lmao I feel like I’d just miss the tile and fall
Wait whoa what if the island that girl said she wanted to visit if she won is the one they’re on
Is it whoa or woah

Ok last night I smoked and then thought in bed and I really should have taken notes...anyway I was listening to Fuck Your Feelings which was really interesting and reminded me of the kind of man I want to be. Over the summer when I was hiking and listening to Can’t Hurt Me I felt high even though I wasn’t because the endorphins were letting me become myself and the book was emphasizing the thoughts I want to be having more.
Who you are is who you think of yourself as in the in between moments. When you’re walking to class, laying down to go to sleep, eating. Not who you are for a couple of minutes talking to someone.
You have to like basically turn your phone off while you watch a lecture or you get distracted
The way being high makes you want to do homework, I think working out would be similar
Literally wake up at 7 AM tmrw, work out, go to CVS, return the flag, and do homework until your 3:00 class
Study for Chinese
Stats formula sheet
Clinical Eval
Catch up on security
Woah I only have 4 classes
Focus on making your hair flat in the back with like gel or spray or something
Get hair setting spray hahaha
You need to take better notes on lectures bc with slides you can take vague notes and then go back and look like (Page 4: how to do blah blah blah)
Man all the commands from the first lab and just type out their summarizing sentence
I think like 45 minutes before an event is good like for your audition that’s when you should vape like 1 medium to long hit




DEC 11 2021 – Docs
So I was thinking about age more than usual tonight. I went to a party at Zoe’s and it was all seniors and like this 24 year old man lol but I vibed with them so much more. Like sometimes I think being raised either female or as an only child always around adults, I’m just more like responsible? Like I do dumb shit like drugs and have no self control when it comes to food, but around other people I’m pretty mature. Like I think I’ll meet my soulmate in my 20s, out of college unless I meet someone in college who’s also weirdly mature. Like I’ll be the guy who’s like c’mon do drugs with us to my friend but I’m also the guy who will stay up with him if he has a bad trip. 
Also I like NEED friends at parties. I can't go alone haha. Or I need to work on trusting myself to talk to people and form a group.
Maybe they cast 20 year olds as high schoolers bc high schoolers aren’t mature enough. Like I think Tom Holland looks young but is hella mature.


12/12/21 - Focalin 9:07 PM


If you ever post a work/internship pic you should be like “I’d like to thank…wait this isn’t LinkedIn”
Am I like on a dopamine social media validation kick today haha I made 3 tiktoks and then an insta post oops
I think my insta caption game is funny in the way that my cards against humanity humor is like some people don’t get it but it’s like logical funny? Not chaotic funny


I should start using the beard oil I do want facial hair there lol
I feel like my social anxiety tonight is similar to high school levels idk if it’s because of the low self esteem pencils or the focalin or maybe weed/alc withdrawl hm maybe lack of nutritionous food, now that i think about it i am kind of in a rut like self-care wise…I’m also a day late on my t shot, and i haven’t taken my antidepressents in a couple of days…..now that I think about it it’s not surprising at all lmaoooo
Also today I wasn’t super like academically productive but I think I was personally productive. I did laundry, made my bed, worked out, played piano, made some TikToks, did some Chinese/psych homework, currently am working on self development…
I’m basically double majoring in clinical psych and self development at this point lmfao
LMAO wait I should do a case formulation for myself and then look up the different diagnoses ahaha


Write the psych questions you got wrong on exam 1 and 2 on your calculator notes


Alexander Stewart’s cover by Justin Bieber’s Anyone is perfect range-wise


Stop typing in passive voice “I was wondering”


Not me considering showering now because I wanna sing haha I’m never sure how much people can hear from the hall tho…maybe don’t use the bathroom next to us, go to the left one

DEC 24 2021 – Docs
Games like the Harry Potter bejeweled are just like addictive because they’re on your phone. Like if it was on your switch, you would pick other games over it every time. But because it’s on your phone, it’s like easier to just play then to take out your switch, which on reflection is literally the easiest task ever but in your brain it’s built up as something.
Like I think a lot of your problem is with impetus - you perceive starting things as a lot harder than they actually are, but once you start you’re like oh ok lol
Being high helps you overcome impetus because you’re more open to experience and it feels more like novelty, adhd meds help you overcome impetus by making you more ‘rational’ and you think of starting things as the not big deal that they are
Anyway, back to the phone games, playing games on your phone should be a scheduled activity where it’s like I’m going to sit down and play this game, as opposed to just playing it for 5 minutes here and there because all of a sudden 5 minutes becomes 10 or 30 and you’re doing it so much more often. Like maybe un-download games and then just reload them when you want to play? Which is annoying bc you have to login again, but that also raises the block to start….
Be conscious of what are interesting thoughts and what are stupid thoughts lol
Like I was about to write that it’s weird how ‘un-download has a hyphen and reload does not’ and how they’re not complete opposites, but then I realized download and reload are opposites, and you just negated one
So the above was a stupid thought that wouldn’t really spur conversation if you said it to someone - so like don’t say something like that on the pod
Also I do think of my future podcast as ‘the pop’ even though that’s a Popcorn Culture thing
Like I’m worried I’ll just rip off all the podcasts I listen to
Like sure, podcast content matters, but you also have to have bits and stuff with your listeners to make them loyal
So PC has like the one true host, facts about coyotes, the pop…
Infinite Quest hm doesn’t have any I can think off off the top of my head, but they’re also very meta in that they talk about having listeners and like mention them enough that it feels personal
Potterless just has a lot of inside jokes based on dumb things he’s said on the pod so we can probably just make those as we say dumb shit lol
Either be high or run or drum or something to raise masculine self-perception before you record
Also I forgot how great working out then getting high is like you really reap those self-image benefits haha
My goal for 2022 is to get in shape and I stg I will actually do it this year.
Like by the end of college I want to have a TikTok thirst trap body - I basically just want abs and big arms and maybe a dorito shape…and then hopefully to fix my acne
^ Those are my physical goals and then mentally I want to start ADHD meds and just like be the mature businessman dude I can see myself being in 10 years.
My ideal friends would be people who are really chill in real life but then we could film shit together and do wild stuff for the attention, but they’re not people who would do that stuff like out of the blue
Ok haha I made a makeshift standing desk bc sitting after jerking off feels weird
So I’ve had trouble falling asleep the last 2 nights (I think it was like 7AM and 5AM?) and I’m wondering if it’s because I haven’t physically exerted myself enough to be tired, or if it’s because I haven’t mentally exerted myself enough
Maybe I can do a little study - for 2 days I’ll be really physically active and not mentally, and then 2 days I’ll switch it. And then maybe do both at the same time? I’ve already been doing neither at the same time for the last like 4 days lol
Wow I’ve been home exactly a week - it feels so much longer but at the same time so much shorter
You really should run again, I remember feeling so good when I used to
Like at your peak you were literally only doing a mile a day, once you get in shape it’ll be like 10 mins of your day
Like now is the time to start because you can die in the corner for an hour after, and you have the free time to do that
I just hate running in winter bc I always feel like I’m boutta slip and die
Idk if its all breaks or holiday breaks in particular, but I also get really like introspective (more than usual), maybe it’s the idea of New Years and resolutions and stuff, but idk
Also there’s no good word for me between stuff/shit/things. Stuff sounds childish, shit sounds adult but immature, and things sounds too formal. Like I like neutral language. I definitely also have a language aesthetic, the way I have a color scheme aesthetic. I also don’t know whether it’s the words or my voice and how the words sound in my voice.
Also ok one of my biggest pet peeves that literally grates on me so hard is when people say something along the lines of “there is other options”. It’s there ARE. Like if the noun following is plural, even if it’s vague plurality it has to be are. Sometimes people even do it if the noun is explicitly plural like “there is two books” just ugh did you not go to school
Also I know I say y’all unironically, but it does sound southern and that’s totally not my vibe. I definitely am a big east coast city boy who imagines like tall dark chic glass offices, not southern farm cowboy.
Ok so podcast topics: aesthetics and how to explain them, is vs. are, 
Oh also it could be a bit where if we don’t use our real names we just make up increasingly stupid names for each other
Also - (i say also a lot) - lol I forgot where I was going with this
My computer stickers are very not reflective of my personality I should update them (and also maybe haha make them not upside down) definitely have a blue and black aesthetic and lowkey it’s kind of weird that you have a sticker with your name on it like have not seen that one before
I genuinely do see myself as so much older than a lot of 19 year olds act tho like I need older friends
Also I think being raised in America is a dealbreaker for me. Other options are the UK or Australia but like I don’t think other cultures really would like me?






Dec 27
For podcast topics, ask yourself ‘would J and Ben talk about it’




Jan 1
At this point you should get a Medium subscription…get a month and see how much you use it then get a year if you do
My aesthetic has gone from 0/0/255 blue to a darker blue not quite navy like the same ~darkness~ as army green




JAN 14 2022 – Docs
Deleting YouTube watch later:
* Drug/Pokemon/HP content
* > 20 mins
(obviously keeping some exceptions)


* Also I should watch ACNH vids especially for the 2.0 update
* I wanna do a tech free day maybe Sunday…I could just do Chinese from the textbook and play with my Pokemon cards and stuff
* Have animal crossing gameplay on in the background while you do homework
* And go to the damn library next semester


1/16
* Focalin at 10 PM, Have been studying C since, is currently 11:15
* It blows my mind when people write programs ABOUT checking programs like compilers and stuff like whaaaa like how did we get from base level to stuff like Python and also can we go even farther
* I’m so torn I was 99.9% set on psych 2 weeks ago but now that I’m getting back into CS I do like it ughhhhh
* If you’re making a fake C string should you do int word[5] or char word[5]


1/17
* ~8 mg chocolate at 10:10, really hitting at 11:26 also so sad this is my last nonschool night in a while
* ACNH gameplay no commentary WITH HEADPHONES would bop
* I think you (as in me) get ‘addicted’ to pot because my only inhibition around it is the first few times I do it with no tolerance I get really anxious, so I have some anxiety surrounding it, but once I’ve done it a few times and realized I’ll be fine then I’m ok being high all the time and I don’t have a reason to not want to
* Idk why the fuck I called it pot its weed
* Ooh I should use the back massage thingy
* The more I do weed, the more psych softer masc Theseus comes out, but when I’m sober I’m more like militaristic compsci
* Dude I think you gotta work out to feel like good Theseus. Maybe weed -> not working out either because you feel better about yourself and don’t feel the need or being more in tune with physical pain and wanting to avoid that
* But when you were really working out in the summer I think your metabolism got faster or something, so that you wouldn’t get too high or you wouldn’t have anxiety
* Bro ok if your parents work out more than you that’s sad you GOTTA work out
* Hm taste feels off
* You can't do things halfway so you don't do them rather than do them completely
* Like you just feel weak when you’re high
* And earlier you couldn’t lift that case of water on your shoulder
* And your toes hurt because you spend more time laying down than standing up you lazy fuck
* Sleep length is totally determined by your mindset - you've never intended to take a nap and slept for more than 2 hours, and you've never gone to bed for the night and woken up early
* Even time intended to get up - if I know I can sleep for whenever I'll sleep until 3 but today I knew I had a 10:30 alarm and then woke up at 10
* Like I usually wake up before my alarms and am in the half state
* It's quite rare these days that I wake up from RED sleep to an alarm
* Maybe having things playing in the background while you sleep decreases the quality of your sleep?
* Ooh I'd like to study sleep as a psychologist like how long versus mindset 


FEB 15 2022 – Docs
* I think you do well in tests when you’re focusing 100%...when you’re doing hw you’re almost never focusing 100% you’re like having your little inner monologue going.
* And going somewhere else to do HW can really help, especially if you can spread out and just get in the zone
* You want a window in the background to study
* I wonder how distracting having my desk mirror is like how much time do I spend looking at it lol probably too much


MAR 1 2022 – Docs
* I think I like doing medium-important tasks the most - like I want to procrastinate things that are due soon, and I’m not motivated to do things with no deadlines, but if it’s a deadline farther out it feels like being productive
* So maybe getting ahead at the beginning of the semester would make me productive the whole semester
* What if you actually made Psychonetrics into an app that would be a huge resume boost
   * Is the name too long
   * I mean at LEAST finish the design that’ll be a cool portfolio thing
   * And make your personal website
   * If you need to, take any low paying internship you can get and then just work on a personal portfolio and like start applying for next summer this summer haha
* I think silence might actually make me feel like sick
* Stop listening to podcasts like book read alongs, like relisten to Popcorn Culture. Like I’m not THAT invested in J and Bens’ lives, but I AM invested in their personalities and like them as people
* Like I don’t care what you do, I care how you think
* Unfollow YouTube/Podcasts that aren’t helping you grow
* Keep FitTok, inspiration, some people you’re invested in, but unfollow all the thirst trap guys lol
* Unfollow the soft guys / gay guys like you’re looking for role models not thirst traps

* Type up your other high thoughts
* Type up your GM HireVue notes
* UPMC is definitely more promising than Everlight
* You’re a mix of Spiderman and Batman like they’re such polar opposites but that’s why you’re in the middle
* Since starting T I think I sweat when I sleep a lot more especially if I sleep shirtless
* The Batman green vial clip but with testosterone for a TikTok
* Is it that not working out makes me crave junk food less, or that working out makes it feel less guilty
* That whole movie you were focused on like gender and the interactions between men and women (specifically batman and his girl)
* I was so confused by who was who by the end tho
* Lol like it’s not a racist thing at all - if there are multiple women of color in the same movie they all look the same to me, but ditto with multiple white men
* Hang out shirtless at night






MAR 11 2022 – Docs
* Take notes like after you read a chapter or article
* Because then you’ll remember long-term the things you thought were important at the time
* Like really just main ideas, but the details will be linked to those main ideas
* Like you’re not gonna go back and read 10 pages of clinical psych notes, but you would go read like a little paragraph for each class
* Maybe 5 sentences, bullet point format so it seems shorter than a paragraph to read
* I wonder how long my notes actually would be in paragraphs, what if I’m wrong and I perceive bullet point lists as longer to read because there’s more items

- Meditation doesn’t even need to be head empty no thoughts it’s just thinking - like what you used to do at night before bed
- You need a balance of consuming content (books, videos, podcasts) and just thinking of your own ideas as well as processing what you consumed that day
- Turn your morning routine into like a speed race
- Enjoy the sunrise - take a walk, have coffee, etc
- Do “challenges” each week
    - Digital minimalism
    - Running
    - Waking up early

- You could think of being high as a chore like just having to sit down for 2-3 hours and type
- I think you need to be good enough at something (ex. typing), not ex. certain video games...that you can do it without thinking like the way you zone out when you’re walking or something so that then your mind is free to like be creative while you’re just sitting there doing the think subconsciously
- Use weed as a personal growth tool not just for fun
- Well ok actually you need to balance your personal and work life so if you’re gonna use weed anyway I guess using it for fun is ok
- I want my kids to read Percy Jackson so we have that shared formative experience
- ho
- I think depression really does make you see in darker colors
- But yeah the first few days in a new environment are really important to how you perceive it like the arts why depression hapens at the beginning of a change
- Make your screensaver what your happy highs look like - off white background with lots of green yellow pink Puebla pastel colors
- More balls = happier?
- Story idea - you wake up at age 10 tomorrow. You've been in a coma for a day, but feel like you've aged decades. What do you do?

* I think once I reach a new threshold of masculinity, be it from working out and being bigger or just more confident, any dip below that is like depressing

* Which means my standards have to be constantly improving - and I feel like that could either be a good thing or a bad thing...I guess maintenance is ok too tho, but if I get to the point where I’m working out for an hour every day and having a really restricted diet, that might be hard to maintain

* Drumming was top-tier today I feel like I was really learning rather than going through the motions

   * Warm-up: Let Her Go (2), How Far I’ll Go (1), Treasure (3)
   * Review: Payphone (4), Hall of Fame (4), A Thousand Years (4), Stressed Out
   * New: Best Song Ever (3), This is Me (4), Enemy, The Man Who Can’t Be Moved (4), Don’t Let Me Down (4), When You’re Gone (4)
   * DRUMLVL: West Coast, iPad, Beggin, Bad Habits (1:47 fill), High, As It Was
   * Singing: Ghost, You Were Loved

   * Focalin makes it easy to like spend a long time on something once you’re in the zone like you can stay in the zone but you still gotta get in the zone

      * Zones
      * School
      * Music
      * Cleaning
      * Productivity
      * Learning (internet holes)
      * Whenever you’re feeling down or hopeless, remember that survival is a challenge and you can not give in

      * Like in a zombie apocoalypse, you would be fighting to survive, knowing that death was around the corner, you wouldn’t just give up — your crisis response would kick in

      * The intro to The Gospel Truth III sounds similar to the beginning of a Hamilton song

No matter what happens, there are always things you can look at that seem like the universe is conspiring FOR you. Like having early engineering registration, getting put in the hotel, having your Uber Eats voucher still work...and remember that everything that you do and experience is building towards your future. Look at how everything came together for Engineering Psych. There are clearly things you are meant for, you just have to go through the process of getting there. Trust the process.

Spring Fling
- I think I was more similar to jimmy before I started doing drugs
- Like I understand how people say drugs can change your whole personality
- Because I'm definitely different from adderall and prozac
- But also what's just someone growing up
- Like maybe I would've been the same without proxac
- Probably not tho oof
- The concert was soooo loud
- Like I could feel the bass in me as a feeling not a sound
- I think being rlly high is similar to being autistic idk
- oof I kicked jimmy out for the first time
- I think this is the first time one of us explicitly asked the other one to leave
- I feel bad rip
- What if a study paid conservatives like 1000 dollars to have a few sessions with a therapist where they try to pick apart why they're transphobic
- Bc I feel like it is a lot of sexual fear
- Like I think the way there are girls who absolutely hate men bc they associate them with sexual trauma, there are people who hate trans people bc they were taught to associate them with sexual threats
- For any event you spent more than $1000 or 1/100 of your yearly salary on, you have to be sober when you attend. Same for purchases when you buy them.
- Cherries in cherry garcia are good bc there’s so few, but each one takes a while to eat, so it’s like a surprise, whereas the chocolate chunks are annoying bc there are too many
- It’s like the way boba in boba tea gets annoying bc you really want one every 5 sips or so, but instead you’re getting like 3 per sip
- I wonder if you can ask for fewer boba
- My biggest turn off is people who seem like they would be offended easily
- I can lowkey trace my thought pattern through these notes, I wonder if reading them back I would be able to make the same associations that got me from one topic to the next
- I feel smarter than I have in a while
- Maybe that’s why some people like school
- Like just studying makes them feel good
- Ok this summer you HAVE to spend a couple weeks genuinely grinding Chinese and work (if you get some oof) and working out. Like lock your switch and drumsticks away if you have to. And then work fun things into that schedule
- I wonder if no one’s favorite color is like orange or something because orange-lovers get shamed by orange-haters and then they adopt something more common like blue
- And then the people who do still like orange are the ones who like resisted the peer pressure, or didn’t realize the peer pressure was there bc they were socially awkard
- I think some people are smart in terms of literally how fast their beurons fire, and they're the STEM people
- And then other people are smart in terms of content of thought, and thinking about people a lot making them people smart
- Or maybe those two people are both smart for the same biological reason and their focus just brought them in opposite ditections
- 
- Your new fandom should be Star Wars
    - Like look for merch: Pokemon, Percy Jackson, Star Wars, Harry Potter
    - I think all these fandoms have the same vibe to you because they’re all fantasy-esque in that they all have like aliens or other creatures, and they all have male leads that you sort of identify with (Harry Potter least so)
    - Ooh also Marvel/Spiderman
    - Basically just all the stuff SCB have on set

Generations


- A platform to help generations connect....especially like Asians (which is what comes to mind, maybe Indians too) also I’m sure everyone could use it though.
- Plus a lot of the disconnect is cross-cultural between like first-gen and second-gen...I feel like by third-gen you’re basically just American
- Maybe it’s just me tho? I wish I knew more third-gens
- It would be interesting to compare like 2nd gen vs 3rd gen vs adopted into white family vs adopted into chinese family, etc
- Nationality is so much more of an indicator than race imo
- Like my whole internal vs. external race theory
    - Also tho it depends how much your family instills customs
    - Which I think decreases as you go down through the generations


- I’m not sure what would be on it tho. Maybe like older people could put in customs and stuff?
- And then younger people could come up with ideas to integrate that into more Western/American society
- This is giving MEM vibes
- It could also sort of be a survey of like different values and how those change across generations/nationalities


### Names


- Also random but I want to find a new Chinese name, Xisen is meh also idk what it means
- Like I want something with meaning but that also sorta sounds like Theseus
- Lol wait 1.13% of all Chinese people have the last name Lin/Lim


| “The” | “Seus” |
| --- | --- |
| tuo4(expand/support/push) | hao4 (great/numberous/vast) |
| teng2 (soar/gallop/vacate/clear) | wei1 (power) |
| tian1 (sky, heaven, god, celestial) | qi1 (seven) |
| tie3 (iron, strong, firm) | xiong2 (male, grand, powerful, hero) |


I like tianqi but also that’s weather lmao


I also like tiexiong but it lowkey translates to ironman...


### Adoption


Ok I’m doing all this research in Microsoft Edge for some reason and it feels too late to change browsers so yeah that’s where the history will be


- Wait WHAT I found a statistic that says 1/35 American kids are adopted that does not feel accurate
- Huh apparently Seattle has a lot of only children
- Haha me being a boy adopted from China in 2002 is such a tell
- Interesting also Chinese outgoing adoptions to the US peaked in like 2002-2006 so right in my age group
    - I wonder why it went down tho
- I would be interested in doing a side project or at least research about like adoption haha remember your 7th grade ACT project or whatever
- Interaction between like adoptedness/gender/race/sexuality/ADHD...
- Wait there’s no fucking way there were only 6000 China→America adoptions in 2002 I feel like I’ve met way too many of them then
- I think traditional Chinese culture is v conservative on an American political scale haha, but liberals can’t criticize it

# Self Perception


- Focalin lets you delve deep into a subject rather than jumping from thought to thought
- Like today I started thinking about prime numbers and then how to write a program to find all the primes
    - At first I was like ok just interate for each number x from 2 to x-1, and check for a mod 0
    - Then I realized you only have to check all the previous primes
- So I also learn by thinking and doing, like talking things out and then realizing there’s a better way
- Like question yourself, always ask if there’s a better way to do something, be critical of your ideas like someone else is presenting them for your feedback
- Also with my Tufts friends I think I’m always saying stuff that’s obvious to them about how people think or whatever
- And the reason I think it’s interesting and they don’t might be that to be where we are, you either have to be really IQ smart or really good at people and understanding how the world works or ideally some mix of those
- And I got into Tufts bc I’m really IQ smart and incredibly people dumb
- But they’re more people smart, so they all inherently understand this stuff
- I want someone who I can just talk about like how we think and percieve the world and get to see into someone else’s brain
- For your website once you’re an established professional, go back to the gaming idea but like your life as a character’s backstory
    - “The only way to lose is to stop playing”
- Failure really is good for you though
- Like I think the job search is the first thing where you’ve experienced this much failure, everything else kind of fell into place for you academically
- And it’s making you grow a lot
- Imagine if I got an internship in September, I wouldn’t have grown as much as I have the last few months in terms of understanding myself and how to pitch myself and convey that to employers
- Honestly job interviews and first dates aren’t that different, you’re trying to learn about them while making them see you the way you see yourself
- I think my greatest strength is leraning things quickly because I go through so many hobbies/interests
- Like if I’d dedicated my whole life to one thing, I would be good at going deep into things, but that’s not a transferable skill if it takes 20 years to get that good at the thing
- Instead, I’m good at switching tasks and picking up on patterns so that I can pick up a skill quickly, which is a very transferable skill
- Also from drumming, practice means nothing. Like it will get you good at a song or rhythm, but in terms of understanding how it works, you HAVE to be thinking critically while you play
    - So like 30 minutes of smart practice is a lot more useful than hours and hours of mindless practice
- These are all shower thoughts btw, from the Infinite Quest episode with Tim Ahern
- Also I’m back on my self improvement shit haha
- Instead of just working out, this time I’m more focused on showering/face routine and making my face more attractive is doing wonders for my self-confidence
- Also black hair makes me look more professional, and I think brown/blonde hair makes me ‘cuter’
- So black hair is definitely the look I think
- I think non-dyed hair also gives more self-confidence than dyed hair
- When I see someone with obviously dyed hair I assume they’re not confident in their appearance or else that they don’t give a fuck and don’t care that they look stupid

# First Day of Vyvanse


- You have points of giving up or wanting to change tasks. Normally that happens fairly regularly. On vyvanse it either happens less regularly or you're able to ignore those desires better
- Once you ignore the desire, you can get into flow
- It's like the running thing where you keep giving up when you want to
- Days of focused work vs days of unfocused work
- Get immediate deadlines done first so that's not lurking in the back of your mind
- So like today do Chinese first then work on your website after
- Also place is really important, doing work in your room is not conducive
- Fuck why do I suddenly feel like I'm losing motivation it's only been 2 hours
- Bro DONT take focalin to boost it, you have to experience vyvanse on its own for at least a couple days to set a baseline
- Playing mindless games like ACNH can be good for stimulating thoughts, especially if you're listening to an intellectual podcast, but you have to take notes as you think of things
- You tend to play video games and then cram work, rather than doing work at first and then hanging out with people later when they're also free
- Like your free time doesn't align with other peoples bc you cram work at night and hang out during the day
- Avoid consuming content about meds / ADHD for a couple days so your opinions on vyvanse are your own
- Lol and then I had like 2 sips of alcohol and felt super drunk like I was zoning out and could not focus on the TV and people talking to me


NEXT DAY


- Also I went to bed at 3(?) and woke up at 7, couldn't fall asleep and kind of had a panic attack, and then fell back asleep prob around 8ish and slept until 12 so oof
- This morning was also kinda sad, once I took vyvanse I felt more normal (it's been ab 2 hours now) but definitely didn't notice it kicking in im def more productive tho I called all the insurance peeps and made a todo list
- I need a couple more days to see if it's working haha
- Idk if it's fucking w my serotonin levels tho
- Or dopamine? Idk, like how do they interact? Bc apparently I have a shortage of both 😂
- It's wild how your thoughts can physically change your neurochemistry
- Changing name stuff is fucking annoying
- Oh also this morning for the hour i was up I lowkey had an existential crisis ab if I'm actually a guy but once I woke up again it was gone
- So idk I mean I've had those fleeting thoughts before but they also scare me so I try not to 😂
- Also had interesting dreams last night (during my second sleep I think) where I was making out w KY

# Ted Talk Idea


I was listening to a podcast the other day, and they mentioned that for people who sit 10 hours a day for work, just 30-40 minutes of exercise is enough to put them on par with someone with a more active job. Just half an hour of exercise can compensate for your sedentary lifestyle. Great! Good health information to know, right? But that actually stuck in my mind because of the word sedentary. I always think it’s funny when people say that a person is sedentary because they sit at their desk all day. Like think about the three types of rocks. Igneous are the cool ones, they’re like made from fire. Metamorphmageous are the crystals and pretty ones. And then sedentary is just….a boring gray rock you found in your backyard. And so whenever I hear someone talk about being sedentary, I just imagine a boring gray rock sitting in a chair all day looking at a computer. But igneous, that’s a metaphor for being shaped through trial. Steel forged by the flames - coming out stronger after being tested. Metamorphmagous is the beauty, easy likability, forged over generations of success and wealth. And then sedentary is just…the average joe.


At this point some of you might be thinking, am I at the right talk? I thought this was about creating ideas, not listening to some kid ramble about rocks. I assure you, you are. Because this is how ideas are formed. Maybe some of you thought I was a geology major, some massive mineral nerd. Perhaps others thought…ok I see the metaphor, that’s interesting. And maybe the rest of you thought it was an absolutely stupid analogy. But that’s what ideation is. It’s drawing connections. It’s taking information from one discipline and applying it to something completely different.


I’m going to share with you another quote, something a little more relevant this time. Every idea, concept, whatever has already been invented. So what? Just give up? No.


Think about music. There are 15 notes. That’s it. Yet we’ve written millions if not *billions* of different songs. We don’t need to rewrite the system, and even if we try to make new ideas from now until the death of the sun, we would still have more to do.


I’m sure some of my ideas, and the way I convey information would make my college professors cringe. It might even make my kindergarten teacher feel ashamed. But if you take high-level concepts and simplify them, you broaden your audience infinitely. By making it just a little bit simpler, the people who can understand it increases exponentially. I could have picked an example using high level quantum physics, and everyone would be like “oh he’s smart” but you would also have no idea what I was talking about. Instead, by using 8th grade earth science concepts, everyone got it. Even if you’ve never gone to school, I’m sure you’ve seen a rock.


And sure, maybe you study math or chemistry or physics for a lifetime, and make some incredible breakthrough. But then what? Especially in a world where making a new discovery takes so much more work than before. Everything ‘easy’ to be discovered already has been. Newton dropped an apple and discovered gravity, and now we have to spend 10 years in college and a PhD program just to measure chemicals?


Learning to be an innovator isn’t about specialization. It’s not about knowing any obscure facts or complicated formulas. It’s about knowing how to learn. Not just to memorize, but to analyze, and connect, and question. It’s about putting new information in the context of EVERYTHING you know, and looking for patterns. Because anyone can read a textbook, or do an experiment. But the one thing that makes you unique is you. Your experiences. Your perspectives. So use them.


And sometimes, your ideas are completely insane, like making rocks analagous to people at your TED talk. But if you keep thinking, keep connecting, and keep trying, you will create something brilliant.


Thank you.

- I feel like I should journal more often now that so much more happens in my life
- Like for 20 years, most of my life was spent zoning out or doing mindless things
- And I’ve probably learned more in the last 1.5 months than any other point in my life, both in terms of CS and just like the world of adulting


- I think living on my own will be good bc of the freedom
- Oof I forgot what I came here to write
- OH. So I think my biggest worry if I was ever famous would be having to like ‘act’ for the public. Like my biggest fear is leaving a legacy that doesn’t accurately reflect me. Even if people see my in like a ‘good’ light, I’d want them to know my faults and like the way I think more than any accomplishment.
    - I think people like that are the ones who are more ‘offensive’, because they want to accurately portray themself to other people, even their more controversial stances
- I think Solon is like my ideal son lmao — like smart, curious, kind of like boyish but mature when he needs to be…he also kind of reminds me of me
- And my ideal kid is sort of my clone
- But like a better me
- Like I guess I’ve never gotten to know many little kids well, but I defintely understand that parental instinct now
- Like he has SO much potential wtf he was tracing variables on the first day and today he was doing binary
- Even the stuff he doesn’t get immediately he gets once I explain it
- Also LMAO like game plan and textbooks are so bad
- I think the way I tend to explain things is rlly good bc people usually get it, even if it’s less ‘formal’, and textbooks should be written more like that


Like a textbook explaining binary is like. “Each set of 8 bits is a byte. A bit is a blah blah something fancy. Each bit is a descending power of two and can take on a value of a 1 or 0.”


Me explaining is like: “So each line is like a number. The right most is 1, then 2, and then you multiply by 2 each time. And then if it’s a 1, you add that number, and if it’s a 0, you don’t


- Oof the way I literally come home and just want to code for fun
- I think it’s because I have so many ideas during the day that I can’t act on, and then I can come home and REALLY code
    - Also I’m doing such basic stuff in class I want to do more so when I come home I’m like lets goooo
    
- I feel like Game Plan should introduce I/O before Wednesday afternoon lmaooo
- And the binary given code didn’t work?
- Ik I haven’t really seen the others code, but I feel like I’m one of the better instructors in terms of like CS/technical skill and teaching it
    - Like it’s weirdly easy for me to think of ways for them to change their project
    - Or come up with stuff for Solon to do
- I wonder if people from certain areas are more likely to say my name right, like Hailey said I have that West Coast drawl, so I’m naturally going to say Greek names like Solon more with a soft o, and East Coast people might say it more like saloon the way people say like the-sis or the-sus
- Haha I feel like I gave prof Wang a pass on saying my name wrong bc he’s not like a native English speaker, but I think if I had to talk an Americans that much I would correct them
- RE. being a good technical teacher tho I’m also probably a bad like…soft skills teacher. Like I feel like I’m really good with kids who are smart/interested, but if someone isn’t interested I’m like I’m not gonna waste my and the rest of the class’s time teaching you stuff you’re clearly paying no attention to
- Holy shit tho like Rex doesn’t pay attention, but I feel like he kinda gets stuff, but like oof I think every line of code Donovan has written I’ve had to spell out for him
- Like the way they could not get let variableName = value…..I’m like this is just replacing words with other words 😪
- Idk if Solon seems so much more impessive like…comparatively
- Also tho I think this typing has like lessened my desire to code idk maybe I did all my productive stuff
- It’s interesting how it takes people longer to relearn someone’s name if they change it or have a nickname, but they can learn new names quickly
- Like it’s easier to write than overwrite memories
- Oof why am I talking in such CS terms now
- But yeah maybe that’s why I can learn some stuff quicker, bc I never had super strong opinions/knowledge
- Hmmm but also I like the same movies
- I guess that’s whats solidified in my memories, so it’s hard to ‘overwrite’ by liking new movies
- I wonder if everytime I watch Harry Potter it fuels that like “addiction” or diminishes it
- LMAO what if I left a like encrypted message to Solon on his flash drive and then he could like figure it out when he’s in college or something

# 8/3/22


**THINKING ABOUT THINKING:** I haven’t gotten to write or journal like this since I started working at iD Tech. You should start journaling for at least half an hour before bed. Also, work on your usage of “like” and filler words. Like the way you thought saying him and I was stupid and just said me and him, but now it makes me cringe. Get to the point where listening to like and um make you cringe.


Anyway, I should have written more and kind of documented how I felt throughout the process. I’ve also had some really interesting thoughts and opinions getting to know my 5 coworkers. The nature of this job does make us pretty close.


I think having paragraph breaks allows you to change thoughts without cringing at a nonsense paragraph. Omg and you can just have a few paragraphs for trains of thought that you just like co-edit. There’s not a rule saying you have to write straight down a page, but I think you do that a lot because anything involving scrolling up feels like editing, and you hate that. I always write in a very ‘we’ perspective, which might be why I like assume other people feel what I would feel in that situation? Maybe I should start thinking in more of an I mindset. Like the we mindset is for dating, and holy fuck maybe that’s why I fall for so many people…like how I approach meeting people in general is like how I approach meeting everyone. If you realize you’re probably never going to see 80% of people a gain, you’ll probably act a lot different. 


You should go to like parks or coffee shops and just practice talking to random people. Because then you can go home to your friends and tell them the stories and they’ll also be there if you had a bacd interaction. Knowing you’re gonna be meeting that many people might also help the exercise/diet mentality.


I wonder if handwriting journals instead of typing leads to like less thoughts? Like by default, you need to think slower to journal than to type. But maybe think deeper about the thoughts you do have? Idk, for me I would probably just get too off track. Journaling does make you tell more of a narrative though, and might be more appealing to go back through and read. Try handwriting a journal at some point.


**MINDSET:** My mindset this week is completely different from last session, but I’m also so socially drained it’s hard to enjoy it. Like I’ve felt like I’m back in high school somedays, where I’m trying to make friends or be popular. And it’s also incredible to see how strongly some friendships has formed in just 2 or 3 days. I’ve also gotten more into like singular focus, like the ability to sit at a desk all day and do computer science. I appreciate the silence and alone time a lot more than I used to, maybe because we crave what we lack. I’m realizing I was doing design to appeal to my like OCD/softer side, and I think that would still satisfy me, but I’d prefer to be doing computer science and coding.


I think there are multiple versions of myself that I could become…like in the past there were infinite, but I’m really starting to zero in on a few.


1. Cute in a Nerdy Way CS Guy - Some of these kids at camp but older…maybe Jimmy but like him when he talks about CS
2. CS Guy You Wouldn’t Think is a CS Guy - Charles? Idk most of the iD Tech guys are pretty nerdy…maybe some of the student athletes?
3. I Don’t Give a Fuck About Myself CS Guy - Fat nerd who lives alone and eats chips while gaming all day and doesn’t step outside
4. Soft Boy Who Works in a Not That Tedious Field - Has a lot of time to self-reflect and think and learn new skills


I think you need to have a few lockdown skills where it’s like 99% of average people I meet will not be able to beat me at this. Also remember iD Tech kids are not average people. Some right now are: being able to solve a Rubix cube, hours of Pokemon Go playing, typing speed, being trans*, drumming, singing(?), 


I feel like I’ve really lost my singing voice. That really helps me shape my identity by hearing myself, because I’m such an auditory person. Maybe I like working out so much because 


I don’t know if I should take the school year job with iD Tech. Like this summer almost fundamentally broke who I am, or made me regress like a year in personal development. I think this night is really good, since I’m sitting down and getting everything on track.


Like tomorrow, instead of having stupid thoughts in your head, or just thinking about CS, spend your down time thinking like this. You could even sit where Zach normally sits in the morning, and just keep typing like this. Keep recording all the stories from the last 3 weeks.


Instead of using adderall for CS, use it for self-growth. Oh shit is the reason I’m becoming more myself because I’ve been using weed so much latelty lol. Like I think that always leads me into that mindset to try new things. And then once I get on a personal development path, I stop smoking to free up that time for personal growth.


I think you should spend at least one of your weeks before school starts getting really good at drumming again. Like focusing on fundamentals and rhythm before trying hard stuff. Maybe even go to the practice room and use a real set! So you have three weeks off, so I think you should block them.


1. (at home) Playing a lot of video games and relaxing, learning soft skills like Rubix cube etc., work on personal project (2 hours of a thing per day)
2. Drumming and fitness/diet. These are basically the 2 things you think about for 7 days
3. Some CS, getting back into the student mindset, rekindling that passion for CS by learning fun stuff (which means you should be getting your personal project done before this)


Yooo what if the way to make a vacation feel longer is to do a lot of different things each day. Like work flies by because I’m standing in the same room for like what 8 hours? But when I was running around at the tech camp it felt longer. So cap any one activity per day to like 2 hours. So like 2 hours of coding, 2 hours of drumming, 2 hours of etc. Then the days will feel a lot longer than the breaks where you spent a week sorting Pokemon cards.


I think sorting Pokemon these days is a much bigger commitment since you have so many haha. Like if it was a smaller set I could do it in an hour, and then do something else. But it’s like a full day multi day activity at this point.


**WORK:** Also when I have students like Jackson, who might be better than me in some areas, or people who correct me, it does make me feel pretty inadequate. But I guess it’s also about understanding you’re not the best.


Also I think this job has made my eyesight super shit. It’s literally staring at a computer all day. But is that my future…


Oof I kinda wanna keep doing OTW though…where’s my free time :/ Aw fuck and I wanna set up that server


Maybe Zach is like Jimmy, you have to bond by talking about CS

“gaining window but not knowledge” just sounds like specialization which sucks


Like you should be good at lots of things to see new ways to do things from drawing 2 subjects together


Honestly I was lucky to have interdisciplinary in hs bc it def helped shape my thinking in those more formative years


Like I'd rather have someone who knows 70% about 3 subjects than 100% about 1


Also the learning curve is like 100 hours for the first 90% and then 1000 hours for the remaining 10%


Like mastering something is just such an inefficient use of your time


If I have the financial comfort to do it after like 10 years I could see myself leaving the industry or trying to make my own business or something


Like imagine just getting 5 degrees and spending like 5-10 years working 5 different jobs


Like SWE, UX, lawyer, detective, doctor or something 


I wish stuff like detective or cop was better pay so then I could do those in my 20s and 30s and then do SWE when I'm old and can't do anything else anyway lol


But you need those higher paying jobs when you're young

- I think I’m becoming more of a Ravenclaw…like I think I always knew I had the ability to be hyperfocused on something academic, but I didn’t find it until CS
- But also…I feel like I switch majors so much because of how that major’s external perception aligns with how I’m changing as a person
- Like I do choose things to do/be interested in based on their outward social percpetion. Not even that things are cool or not, there are ‘cool’ things I wouldn’t want to do, but whether or not if the type of person society associates that activity with fits me
- Like I hesitated to do CS because of the perception of being nerdy? But also I feel like I thought I wouldn’t get to socialize enough, but you actually do vibe rlly well with most CS people, and they probably don’t have a ton of social experience either, so they’re good people to hang out with reliably
- I should take the sorting test, MBTI again
- I think I might be more of an introvert
- Wait the first time I took it I was an INTP. If I’m that again, maybe that’s what I really am, and all the changes in between childhood and now were me like ‘growing up’ and shifting to try to meet expectations
    - And now I’m becoming more who I was when I was younger
    - I wonder if it’s bc of transitioning, like I think as a kid I just grew up thinking of myself as male, and then teenage-hood changed that, and now I’m back to more of the way I was as a kid
        - And maybe that’s what we all strive for — it feels the most natural, or ‘who we are’, because that’s literally how we developed
- Weird, even the content you like has shifted, like I’m hesitant to watch season 3 of HSM bc I don’t super see myself as a musical person? Even tho I do still enjoy singing, but maybe more pop now
- Yeah I haven’t listened to musicals in a while
- Also, when doing ‘busy’ work, you should watch TV when you can instead of listening to podcasts, bc you have plenty of podcast time while walking and stuff
- I think I like shows where you learn stuff…like MacGyver, even if that isn’t super like ‘realistic’
- Or cop/military shows
- Ooh you should watch those like emergency response shows
- Oh woah you can make Google watchlists
- Honestly I think you’d use Paramount+ a lot
- Oh I feel like you used to watch at least a season of one of those shows where they’re in space?
- Oof maybe the change is I don’t like ‘young adult’ stuff anymore, bc I looked at that section of Paramount+ and there was nothing I’d want to watch
- Like I like what used to be young adult stuff. But now that’s like stuff for people in their 20s
- Like kids TV is either sickening Disney stuff or Euphoria lmao
- Maybe u should watch Euphoria
- I feel like if they made something like Love Simon or Heartstopper but with a trans guy I would def watch it
- I wish there was some kind of media about a very masc trans guy who struggles more to find his mascuilinity than to just have the whole plot be about transitioning and getting bullied
- I guess it would probably start in college? I think the challenge would be to introduce the fact that he’s trans and have that be the main plot, without people assuming he’s the kind of trans guy that makes it his whole identity
- Gahhhhh writing is hard
- Maybe I should write it lol


- I think it’s funny that my August pic is ‘free’, which probably is meant for like 0 dollars, but to me is actual freedom
- Free is a weird word in that no cost = independence?
- A really good drummer should actually look robotic…like with other instruments you want to improvise, but drummers have to always be on the beat, even if they play different things
- Like you can’t improvise with rhythm or syncopation or that kind of stuff as much, because backbeats where they shouldn’t be just sound awful
- Yeahhh you should stick to watching the top drummers rn so you don’t accidentally pick up any bad habits
- Sort things by URGENCY and EFFORT (so like high priority, medium effort)…prob the best tasks are high priority low effort, but lately you’ve been focused on like middle priority high effort
- I basically type like I text…so like this is why I text more cohesively than most people, because I am just typing in what I would type on a keyboard.so like this is why I text more cohesively than most people, because I am just typing in what I would type on a keyboard
- I think I like Theseus bc it’s such a unique name, and I can make it whatever I want it to be. Like with other names, there’s already a perception I’ve grown up with, and I would be pushed towards that. Like Theo is softer than I want. Even Zach or Jake would push me towards being more bro-ey. Or Evan. Even was what my parents were gonna name me, but I wouldn’t use that bc of DEH.
- HAHA write your random thoughts here, not in the book planning doc
- I wonder if it’s hard for me to sit down and write, because I have to ignore my other thoughts, but I always think they’re such good thoughts even if they aren’t, but I’m like ‘it’s a shame to not write this down’
    - You should try writing w/ adderall, you only write w/ weed lol
    - But also maybe people with ADHD are just people who think their thoughts are important and constantly get distracted by them? Idk
- It’s easy to talk to people and just listen passively, like you to do podcasts, but you have to like actively engage, and come up with your own thoughts
- It would be fun to give drum lessons on the side if I get good enough
- Set a goal of like 14-15 inch biceps, and if you hit it, get an armband tattoo. I’d say 14 if ur current is sub 12, 15 if it’s above 12
- I feel like laptop shopping/research is dangerous
- Using ‘lol’ and ‘haha’ so much in texting gives me girl vibes idk like that social awareness to please? I think guys write much more straightforward-ly and I should iron that out
- I fricking despise youtube shorts
- Side ads are much more bearable than top ones where you have to scroll just to see the title of the article
- When picking a bag color I was like I can’t get red, I associate that with school (which means also drums? Both are like focus) and then blue is chill, explore, video games vibes, and then green is like now, more just thinking (do that w/ your room lights to the point where you notice if the lights are the wrong color) hmmm that could make doing work in public annoying tho idk
- I think I have shirt colors or like bag colors (dark blue, army green, dark red) and then accessory/pants colors (dark grey, brown, black, tan)
- Dark grey is better than tan I think
- And then like not too black, more of a really dark grey
- Grey sounds darker than gray
- Darkness = opacity, in that I like things of generally high darkness, but not 100%
- I think I understand what like adderall withdrawl could be like, just in terms of being so understimulated, trying everything, and getting nothing
- I think I see the appeal of going to church and doing confessional, it’s basically free therapy lol


Drumming


- I think a really good place to be drumming-wise would be the ability to hear songs and play back the drum part
    - There’s 2 areas:  knowledge/mental skill, which is like kind of knowing the rhythms, seeing patterns, recognizing different drums, and then technical skill (which hand you’re using to hit what,
    - Get into the habit of practicing patterns like with the hand movements and slowing it down, and see if you can see which patterns work best for you
    - Plug headphones into drums and then just play with sheet music and see if it sounds right

- wow smoking hits so much harder than edibles haha
- Also idk if this is the first time I smoked RIVHT after adder all?
- I def feel less scattered than usual when this high tho
- Like I don't have the high thoughts, just feel more awake and stuff but he guy h tv he got get get get TT f fed bc reeder flu uii I r fe free g get red gym hey hey you y r hi h mom N mmm mmm mmm k
- Ok that was a key smash accident I am literate/coherent
- It's funny how that guy put t for my name bc he couldn't spell it, and the next day that guy at the Red Sox game was like “I'll just call you Percy Jackson”
- Like I go places alone, and no one rlly talks to me, but when I'm with other people people will approach my friend and then me like automatically
- Like am I just unapproachable 😂
- But also I do like always have earbuds in….
- Maybe don't wear earbuds? But then it's like “in case someone talks to me”, and then if no one does it's sadge
- Or I should make jokes / comments to strangers more and not wait for them
- Or lolllll maybe it's bc I look young and adults are like weird about talking to kids
- Like I think it's a lot more normal for someone my age to be like flirting with a 17 year old than a 30 year old…..the laws around that never rlly made sense to me
- Like maybe an age gap that widens as you get older?
- Smoking is a lot better in terms of thought. I think this was like lemon haze?
- Reading that script rlly did give me the motivation to act again
- I wonder if Luke would want to read through the script haha
- But also being high helps you create a character so much better
- I would have to be high for every rehearsal, so we'll see how feasible that is
- Doing the play could be a rlly good complement to CS next semester tho
- So like classes, interrobangers, public harmony, working out, drumming, quid if you have time?
- And classes would be SWE (3) + Interrobangers (2) + OOP/Psych (3) + Music engineering (3)? Oof you'd still have to take 1 tho like maybe do OOP and psych or 2 psych….see how hard SWE and OOP are together I guess

- I think this kind of is like my therapy…writing
- Like it’s all the things I want to say out loud but probably shouldn’t? A lot of self-introspection, that other people might see as just like self-obsessed


- I should watch the harry in slytherin videos, bc its so interesting going from audio only and then seeing the video
- Like you should try watching movies with just the sound, and then watch the movie like visually
- I feel like I’m just a weird combination of guy stereotypes
- I think you should sit up more so your eyes aren’t so close to your computer
- It’s so easy to lose yourself in a world of code
- Like where that’s all you’re thinking about


- Hm yeah I’m feeling uncomfy high already about 10 mins in oopsies
- Like you never learn your lesson about less is more
- I think going home for 4 days or whatever and not craving or thinking about weed is personal growth
- Shit maybe this isn’t as good a high bc you just sat around for 4 days
- Like bro you HAVE to make walking/running part of your life

- I’m definitely a lot more self-aware than I was when I went to therapy in high school
- I wonder if all big changes come with a time period of like depression
- Like obviously there was the one between high school and coming out as trans
- Like this is probably the most significant change/hyperfixation I’ve had in a while
- And I think if I do it right, I won’t have to go through another painful transformation
- Like you were talking about the evoluion of Theo to Theseus, but I think this is it right here
- Like, you’ve always dreamed of working in an office at a big tech company and just doing smart people shit
- Like make sure you’re working out and even if you aren’t socializing be reading/learning about psychology/social interaction, and then you’re limited socializations will grow into deeper friendships
- I think periods of change might also require like weed every now and then to reflect on how it’s going
- Like NOT every night, but both weekend nights or something
- I think having housemates will make you more productive haha but I’m already kind of socially exhausted and it’s only been what 2 days?
- Lol why do I look at myself in the mirror and see a demon
- Maybe you aren’t in the right mindset for acid…
- Like start taking walks by yourself, taking that alone time
- Like I think coding has become my hiding place from the world
- But also can burn me out
- This is why fixations like Pokemon were safer

- I text way more informally on Grindr than anywhere else
- Like I can feel myself getting more informal but keep trying to text more formally
- I think u need to practice clear communication
- Which probably isn't the best high
- I think if you just get engaged talking to someone, it'll be fine
- Sometimes you just can't engage though
- Remember how you feel tn
- Like curious to meet people and genuinely wanting to talk to people
- Just openness, no podcasts, your own thoughts
- And just talk to people
- Like if you have a side comment you'd make to your friend, just make it to the person next to you
- Or especially in CS classes you can just ask what cs stuff they like 😂
- Like making cs friends shouldn't be that hard
- Pack at night so in the morning you can just go
- Like mise place or whatever

# Sep 8


- I think being high and coding could be really good for enforcing my enjoyment of CS
- Like on Friday literally just get high at 10 AM and learn Java the rest of the day
- Also I think fuck quidditch you’re clearly not looking forward to it
- Stop going to things you don’t enjoy
- I think JumboCode and Acting will be really good for me this semester in terms of leadership and people skills
- Haha maybe I will take public speaking next semester
- Like tbh I don’t rlly want to take 3 more psych classes, but
- I truly see all non-CS classes as like dreadful now haha
- Like the way I used to feel abut history
- Now that I’ve seen what it’s like to learn about things I’m interested in, it’s hard to have the motivation to learn anything else
- Also I think my chair needs to be taller so I can comfortably sit at the desk, but then I need a footrest haha it’s a whole thing.
- Definitely sit up straight when you type, you tend to slouch over the computer
- Although,
- Maybe being approachable is just about sitting up straight and wearing your retainer haha
- Like I swear to god the retainer changes your mood the next day so much
- Def wear it tn
- In fact, put it on
- And yeah I’m realizing that living in a house with a bunch of cis straight guys is a bit….much.
- Like I really went from knowing none, to being friends with a few, to living with a few
- It’s like marrying someone after a year of casually dating
- Damn I’m quite high lmao
- Like I spent 2 hours rolling the rest of the lemon haze and batman, and then a bit of purple haze
- I had the purple haze tn, altough it may have still had a bit of mix in from lemon haze
- Also pick up your glasses brooooo
- Ok this is from the leafly strain quiz but I think I have 2 kinds of highs I go for. Ok maybe 3.
1. Bed time - Aroused, Giggly, Relaxed, Sleepy
2. Socializing - Energetic, Euphoric, Happy, Talkative, Uplifted
3. Productivity - Creative, Focused, Energetic, Happy
- I wonder if people spend a lot of time on leafly’s website because they go there when they’re high and then get too distracted to finish doing what they were there for
- I think having a ‘high thoughts’ section in your class notes is interesting, and you could def do it in less important classes to stay focused,
- Oof I think I might just stare at my screen all lecture if I do notes that way and never actually look up at the whiteboard so yeah gotta nix that one.
- Only type things that you want to look up or learn more about later
- Ok maybe do get a seperate keyboard because this is like too wide for my hands
- And it’s harder to type on
- Slumping just makes you feel weak, list you gotta sit up straight and work out more my guy
- Like even if you don’t go at 7 AM, just go at some point
- Like today, you were sitting at your desk like huh what should I do
- When you could’ve been going to the gym!!
- Like your default go to should NOT be going on your computer
- It should be taking a walk, or drumming, or doing something active
- Lol what if you got a medical marijuana card like unless
- Also you need to take t breaks for adderall/vyvanse on the weekends so that you can actually be productive during the week
- Because it’s definitely not hitting as hard
- 


How do you want to feel? Creative, energetic, focused, happy, sleepy


Which effects do you want to avoid? Anxious, dry eyes, dry mouth, paranoid


Medium THC


Sativa


Creating something

- I wonder how much websites can get when you like type in a username or password or email, but never submit the form, can they get the data anyway?
- Also I feel like I never even considered hacking as an option, but now I’m like hey why not
- You could first write a program to try all the URLs and save the ones that get accepted into a file, then you can wget all of those?
- What if you could send login requests or something to a specific subpage without having to go through all the folders/root
    - Then you could just give it some cookies and login


SEP 29 2022 – Notion
- When you have tasks like ‘finances’, you put it off because when you do it it’s so all or nothing, like it’s a 4 hour endeavor…just make it like updating your basic asset spreadsheet, checking on stocks, and it’ll take 20 mins tops. Like actually set a timer if you have to.
- You need the majority of your thoughts to be in productive Theseus mode so that that’s your default. You can’t be socially aware while high, but not the rest of the day, because then your impulse is to say stupid shit
- Like when you’re sober and just sitting in silence, be practicing social skills or observing people
- You are on electronics way too much rip
- Also talking to people with ADHD is so interesting like you can finally relate lol


OCT 1 2022 – Notion
- Oh god when did it become October??
- START WORKING OUT MORE. Think of it the way you now take prozac unthinkingly. Instead of a ‘benefit’, treat it as more of a need for your happiness
- UX thing - for your Fall 22 shortcuts folder, you should make it so that the main class page is on top of it’s Q&A page bc if you want something for 160 you just click the first thing reading top to down that says 160 even if it’s the Piazza or something


OCT 5 2022 – Notion
- You did a voice recording last night, transcribe that at some point
- Yeah you were too high at that meeting it was stupid
- But if you’re that level of confidence while sober…it’s gonna be good dude
- Keep working out
- Also you did so much better today than 2 days ago in terms of like staying in the gym even tho you didn’t want to
- Like even if there’s nothing you actively want to do, just hang out. Something wil catch your eye
- Think of it more as a playground, but where you have a status bar of energy, and you want to like spread it out on as many machines as possible rather than burn it all on one
- Like would you rather ride the 1 really big roller coaster once or ride 10 medium sized ones
- And lock into at least 3 sets per excercise
- Then to do everything you want, you’ll have to complete the other ones
- Like omg make it a game


3 sets of dumbbell curls


3 sets of seated rows


3 sets of seated push


3 sets of bench


3 sets of seated leg curls


3 sets of knee push in


3 sets of knee push out


3 sets of seated leg press


3 sets of laying dumbbell raises (over face)


3 sets of barbell curls


3 sets of behind the head barbell raises


3 sets of squats


Like you CAN’T bench until you do those other 9 sets


Also this could be your bulk - like don’t worry about calories UNLESS you’re not going to the gym — otherwise, eat to your hearts content and know it’s becoming muscle


I think being a professional PM would be fun - like exercising creativity and management and developing


I do really like developing all day though


It’s like something to lose myself in


Also don’t be afraid to reach out to the client


When you’re not high, dumb down the subpage descriptions and send it for like ‘approval’

# Oct 6 2022 Thoughts


- I think people should go to college with ‘similar’ people for their first year, like how Tufts is a bubble so you can meet people like you and find a solid group of friends, and then you and those friends transfer to another school where it’s like a whole mix of people, like Tufts and BYU together, so that you escape that bubble and actually get like an accurate representation of what people around the country are like.
- If I were to make a movie, it would be about like a trans guy in college finding himself and in the end being this like masculine self-confident guy
- Sorta like the cis guys that people think are gay bc they’re not mean, but are actually straight
- I like to believe that your childhood/upbringing doesn’t affect you that much, and that you can totally change your peresonality and thought pattern just by changing your lifestyle

# Oct 11-12 2022


- I think I'm becoming more authentically myself right now
- Like the kid I would have grown up as if it wasn't for…all the other stuff
- Like probably from 13-17 I didn't rlly get to develop as a person at all bc I was so depressed
- I feel like now it's really easy to look back and say wow it does get better but I truly didn't believe that at the tume
- At least you can look back at this if it ever happens again
- I guess my other fear is that instead of becoming myself, I'm getting depressed again
- But I think that might just be like a phobia
- Idk jaha
- I'm def in better shape than becore
- Although…I didn't love that ny triglycerides we're that high
- I think diet/fitness is about statistics
- Like if you have a goal weight, a goal number of calories, a gal bloodwork Star, it's easier to stay on track because the minutia between having a cheat meal or skipping a day of exercise do mayter
- It's almost like how numeric grades give you more motivation
- Bc I know I can get an A…but to beat the goal I have in my mind (98), I have to actually study
- Lmao imagine if I studied this much in HS instead of being sadge
- I could be a CS genuis
- Or at least really really understand all of my HS subjects
- Like now I feel like school is such a larger part of my life than ever before
- Which is funny bc I do have a life outside of school here
- Like in HS the only thing I DID was school
- But now I like socialize and do clubs and stuff
- Oh and I want to go out more
- Not even going out to bars, just like going into boston
- Maybe set aside a day every week to go to boston
- Walk around commons, hit up Newbury street, study at Copley...
- Prob fridays once the play is over
- GOD once the play is over I'm gonna have so much free time
- But also I feel like I could just as easily waste that time
- Like stay this strict to your schedule
- Set aside all of Friday, half of Saturday, and T/H nights, and don't do any work then. But don't play video games either. In fact, maybe they are 4 non technology hours
- Like literally put your computer away if you have to
- Go to the gym, do self grooming, self reflection, learning/reading, going for walks…
- I guess tech for music and typing notes but that's it
- Flex chron actually is interesting, but what if it reorganized your schedule to minimize that in between time
- Like instead of you being like “15 mins between classes”, it could figure out the minimum time it takes you to get from point A to B, and then fills every other second with something to do, and like reorganizes things so that you can have larger time chunks to do stuff, and not a bunch of small chunks
- Ooh you could lift 3 times a week and then go on a PoGo walk 3 times a week and 1 could be Friday/Saturday where you go to Boston Commons
- Like going there for Comm Day is so fun
- It's the difference between saying “sorry for the delay” and carrying on doing good work vs saying sorry and explaining the whole thing and wasting time
- Like learn how to say no to people to spend time learning or working and then save your social energy for the people you like


FOR TOMORROW


- WORKOUT / POKÉMON GO WALK

# Oct 15 2022


I hung out with Emma tonight and it was so nice. Like it’s really nice to just hang out with girls after hanging out with like bro-ey guys all the time. Like I have these two very distinct sides to my personality, and most people only like 1. But it was very nice and open and we talked about a lot of deep stuff. Like we talked about her time in Seattle lol, and then what we want in relationships. I said that I think out of all the people I’ve met in my life, Fiona was the best match for me, and I think that’s true. Emma agreed and said we seem similar, but I’ve given up on that haha. I also kinda want a relationship at this point in my personal growth to see how I act in that kind of interaction, and build my like ‘romantic’ side? I just want more friends that I can be that open with lol. I’m actually so excited for next semester. Like I’ll have eons more free time, and with Ian gone (oops) I feel like I might actually get to hang out with the guys and do stuff I like. I don’t think I’ve really had 1-on-1 time with Luke or Marco since school started, and that’s kind of put some distance between us. The onnly 1-on-1 I’ve really done with the housemates is when I went thrifting with Felix which was actually really fun. Like he’s not into emotional stuff, but he is a really nice guy.


Idk I feel like Carlie doesn’t like me and that I’m reading into things, but I could also be gaslighting myself. I guess just see how things go, and try to be a little more flirty.


Instead of weed, you should ‘use’ Adderall more. Like especially these next 2 weeks which are going to be actual hell. Like weed is kinda making you stupid. But adderall just boosts productivity and I think really lets you see things in more of a realistic way and be more practical, whereas weed makes you more open to possibility and more creative. Like weed is P and adderall is J in the MBTI.


Honestly I have no idea what my MBTI type is at this point. I’ve changed a lot even since last spring. I think it’s awesome changing, but sometimes I have that little doubt in the back of my mind that’s like what if I never find my true self and I just keep changing. Or maybe everyone keeps changing until they find professional success, or a gf/bf, that makes them want to stop changing because they’re happy and content that way.


One of my biggest goals in life is to find self-fulfillment and become most authentically myself. Which I guess is weird with some of the performative masculinity I do. But I’ve been talking less, which I think is kind of my vibe. But I also need to be good with 1-group dynamics to be a PM haha. I guess that’s pretty easy to fake for 1 hour a week though.


Make time for yourself though. Journal. Take alone time. Sing. I think tech is really going to socially drain you, so don’t pressure yourself to like party or hang out with people.


I think a lot of guys come off as assholes because they’re selfish, and aren’t trying to like collaborate with a girl that they see themself spending the rest of their life with, and then they ‘settle down’ when they find someone they actually want to be with.


Ooh hm this is kind of bad but maybe I feel more confident around the guys after time around girls because then I’m used to being assertive, and it carries over, rather than letting them talk over me

- Yeah, get high right before you go to bed, write some notes, then sleep.
- Interesting how this is an indica, and I definitely feel it more as a body high, but I’m still motivated to write
- Hmmm idk if I’m cognizantly getting more introverted or like depressed, or less depressed, but I feel more introverted? And when I liked sativas more I was like creative
    - Using when I liked sativas as like accepting an identity rather than a fact so quickly is how you change your personality so quickly
- You need to be working out as you lose weight, or else you’re gonna look ‘soft’
- I need a good balance of CS and singing/theater. Like focusing on CS for 8 hours straight, then
- If you want to procrastinate, instead of playing games start reading old notes
- Yeah I could not act on an indica though…like sativas are good for when you want to be around people

Your problem with CS is that you do stuff you like to do that’s CS related, like look at bash shortcuts or speeding up your computer, and then in your mind you track that as time spent on CS, so you don’t spend time doing actual CS work…

Haaa it’s 10 AM, not my usual writing time. I tried RVR last night, it was pretty good. I didn’t have many thoughts, but it kept me clear headed enough that I probably could have done work.


I think the only issue with my weed usage right now is that when I smoke I want to just relax. But that could also be bc rehearsal is draining all of my usable energy…After the show I really want to get back into like working out, smoking, then doing work.


OR work out in the morning, caffeine and/or adderall, and then lunch, smoke in the afternoon, more work?


But yeah get a daily substance schedule going so it’s not so impulsive


Anywayyyyy I came here to write a preshow ritual


- Shower / Hair (listen to character music) (40 mins)
- Walk over (15 mins)
- Vocal warm-up (Granoff) (30 mins)
    - Scales
    - Vocal slides
    - Day is Done
    - Lines (Volume!)
    


Ok so you need an hour and a half, which means today you need to start at 4:30, and other days at 5:00.


Playlist ideas


- One song representing every side of your musical tastes
- Reccomendations you like…and it’ll keep reccomending
- All of your liked songs, and then another playlist of reccomendations based on that
- Playlist of every song you saved the radio of
    - 35


- Use AI to discover who you are haha - spotify, youtube, tiktok, pintrest…let the algorithms do their thing, just search for stuff you’re interested in and will benefit from
- Like YouTube just feeds you productivity stuff now and its great


Apologize (OneRepublic), Tonight Tonight (Hot Chelle Rae), Enchanted (Taylor Swift)


ahk try all combos of hotkeys


Code RBT, BST→List


In-order, pre-order, post-order

Starting this on 11/1/2022 (well I guess more like 10/31). COPY stuff here, don’t cut it. Oh that’s gonna be a bitch with apple notes. Welp whatever. I’ve also started swearing way more…


Lol not me thinking about a speech or thing to say to Carlie to ask her out:
I know I’ve been kind of distant or like not myself the last month or so, rehearsal has actually killed me, and I didn’t realize how off I was until it ended. But during that time, I’ve been wanting to ask you out, and now that I can be a person again, I’d love to get to know you better.


Anyway. Stop writing. Start copying.


Lol you are SO ADHD you literally got distracted looking for fonts that are best for ADHD. Like I think the things that really suck you in are productivity, self-improvement, and coding.


I like acting, but I honestly think it’s counterproductive to my self growth, because I’m taking time I could be working on myself and spending it pretending to be someone else


Honestly I think in the years after they come out, trans people shouldn’t act…like that time is so integral to your formation of your identity in the world as your correct gender


Ooh google docs shortcuts are gonna be good for my productivity


Like with Notion it’s so limited


Docs is so much more customizable…oof I bet I’m gonna end up writing Excel or Docs scripts at some point


I’m finally starting to think about how things work in a CS way, like looking at Google Docs and doing stuff under the hood, like customizing it and making custom shortcuts


Once you start thinking ‘hey, this heading is just a place for me to save a combo of boldness/font/size/color I use a lot’, you can use it for other needs.


Lol what if I taught an ex-college class that’s just like productivity…unless…like AHK/Scripting/Shortcuts


Start using Win + # more…
Also I think using Lexend is going to be good for my productivity because it makes reading feel more novel


My favorite colors really are like that dark red, dark blue, and dark green that I have on GoodNotes


Maybe my aesthetic was just shaped by what’s common


Like maybe my ideal aesthetic would be the average of everything I’ve seen,


Ooh, make your color scheme thing / pinterest board


Also look at specifically data / AI/ML / pattern recognition jobs


I’m like more excited for life and the future than I have been in a while


Is it because I’m gonna start Accutane??


But you really should read this tomorrow morning. I mean it this time. And spend time tomorrow reading old thoughts too….you have 4 free hours in the evening 🙂




“When you think about quitting, think about why you started.”
I’m starting for me. For the betterment of my future, to be the person I should have been a long time ago. I’m starting again because I have seen progress and I will see it again, and surpass what I never thought was possible.


Also I think quiet is good for you, and that’s hard to get a lot of the time…Honestly, try wearing noise canceling earbuds with no music

- I just took a bunch of pictures of me pre accutane and it's so fun
- Like I think the start of my self confidence runs rlly do come from that like photo shoot or getting into myself, and wanting to be better
- I've been in a crush run and not a me run
- Like you rlly are your most eatable when you're focused on you
- Yeah get a haircut
- Maybe your goal is like 2nd semester focus on you, and work on it until then
- I feel like once you get an internship you'll be completely free
- Rlly strive for a light schedule these next 1.5 years
- Like heavy coding is fine if that's all your academic work, but make time for you like this to get high and sit in front of the mirror and workout and stuff
- I rlly said those 2 weeks of a straight summer job broke me in terms of growth and then proceeded to do a play and school and be basically as busy


- I think I really should take like 3 credits a semester next year and really take the time to focus on me
- Like when else in your life are you going to have a chance to basically be free 21/7? Literally never. Unless you take a year off mid-career, but I feel like now is the best time while I’m young


- Talk in the I voice, when you write, not the you voice
- Bc you is for like future 10 years  from now you, and I is for tmrw you
- Also read your old notes!! Maybe a Thanskgiving/Christmas break project? Or those 20 hours on the Amtrak….
- I think I wanted to take Amtrak bc I want to be able to sit down for 10 hours and work and be uninterrupted. Like one of the things I’ve missed most this semester is the ability to do full day work days, like just taking adderall and fucking grinding for 10 hours, and then going home and completely relaxing
- Try to find better vices than sugar and food tho
- Like part of why you lost weight was because you were too stressed to feel like having ‘hang out’ time, so you only ate when you were actually hungry
- So now, you should do other stuff instead of eat
- Or don’t like watch TV and eat
- And just drink water
- I think that was huge
- Try just drinking water for like a week

Tonight’s rehearsal had immaculate vibes. Truly. It was the most I laughed and felt cool in a long time. It was like me being myself within that group of people for the first time, and not feeling like I had to pretend to be more bro-ey than usual, but also not feeling like I was trying to fit in on purpose.


I think not taking Vyvanse today made a difference. Like I took an adderall so I could get some work done, and then had coffee to keep it going, but at the end of the day I was able to let go. I think just using adderall, or only using Vyvanse a couple of times a week could be really good.


Oh also…your triglycerides or whatever going up did kinda coincide with starting ADHD meds…I wonder if that’s a thing?


I’m also tempted to smoke tonight. Like I didn’t smoke last night for the first time in a while, and I had a really slow start today (I skipped EM52  and was late to algo), but by the end of the day I was in a much better mood than I’ve been in a while.


Maybe you should replace either ADHD meds or weed with exercise? Idk, I guess that’s another little interplay to explore.


TODO After Interrobangers
         * Get a haircut
         * Start working out / taking creatine daily or near-daily
         * Dedicate time for drumming/singing each week
         * Journal more
         * Tie journaling to weed, or do some other combination
         * Write about your thoughts of the process as a whole

Talk about how not why

You used to think you were a Gryffindor. And maybe some things you did you thought were brave. And some things you do today people still see as brave. Because you’ve never really been average. On the hardest tests that everyone else failed, you would get an A. But then on the easy ones, you wouldn’t do as well. Sure, you can stand up in front of a crowd and give a speech. You don’t mind being on a stage, and aren’t shy about singing, or acting, or talking. But you’re scared of things that other people don’t see. That most people aren’t scared of.


It’s the things buried inside. You’ve always been running. You rewatch the same shows because you’re scared of feeling. Scared of opening your mind to new ideas. You like to think of yourself as open-minded, but I think you’re becoming so set in certain values and thought patterns that you’re closing off entire worlds. You’re always listening to things because you’re scared to be alone with your thoughts. You avoid actively consuming media, actively doing anything really, because that would mean being vulnerable. And lately, you’ve just been passively existing. The moments when you feel most grounded are doing homework, which is pathetic. But that’s when it’s ‘safe’ to let your mind wholly focus on one thing. Perhaps you need to let your mind focus on having fun, on music, on people.


This summer, after your internship ends, you have to travel alone. Go hiking, go to another country, I don’t care. Just. Do something for you. Have that experience of sitting on a cliff and watching the world unfold. Seeing parts of nature you’ve only seen in pictures. Stop dreaming and start living.


In the course of becoming this productivity bro, this career oriented guy, this ‘adult’, you’ve lost sight of a lot of things. What it means to be curious. To explore. To be a kid. Sure, maybe weed helps with that. But you’re become jaded. You’re growing up too fast. Slow. Down. Just exist. Meditate. Draw. Whatever. But stop feeling like life is a race. Because when you spend too long losing yourself, it gets really hard to come back.


You told yourself after last summer you would never put yourself in that kind of situation where you had no free time. Yet this semester, you did it again. And even after interrobangers was over, you continued, scheduling out study time and workouts, and not just giving yourself that time to exist. And when you did have free time, you played Dominion, or Pokemon. Do a dopamine detox. Just. Be. No work. No coding. No self improvement books. Just get back in touch with yourself.

Alright. 9 hour Amtrak to go. I think this is gonna be a lot better than flying, because even it’s a bit longer travel time, it’s the easiest place to actually do something. It’s almost like giving yourself an excuse to sit in your room at your computer for 9 hours straight without feeling guilty. Cause you can’t really work in a car. And airplane travel is mostly hectic, so there isn’t like a sustained time period to work. Maybe me getting older is becoming disillusioned with air travel and wanting to just take the train like an old person lmao. 


Anyway, I think I might be getting addicted to weed again but that’s ok haha. Like accutane was making me pretty depressed, and if this is just how i have to get through the next 5 months so be it. Towards the end of the semester I was getting pretty sadge. But I also realized (with like 3 days left at school), how important spending time with my friends is. Like idk something about the bomb threats just got me thinking about what’s really important in life.


I also do low-key feel like things work out for me though. Like the night before my 2 finals, my brain decided to stop cooperating and that we were going to play Pokemon for a few hours instead of studying. Truly I would have been massively fucked for that algo exam. And then me applying to CS a bunch and not getting it, and then getting psych and realizing it pays like 4-5x as much…


I’m realizing if you’re losing productivity in a day, it’s best to just call it quits, hang out, go to bed early, and then wake up early and work.


Work on coding something that kinda takes a while, but that you can def do and will feel satisfied by.
